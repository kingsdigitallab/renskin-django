    <p data-block-key="qg5bt">Renaissance Skin was a 5-year research project funded by a Wellcome Trust Senior Investigator Award. Based at King’s College London, the project was led by Professor Evelyn Welch and Dr Hannah Murphy. Over the 5 years, we studied the wide range of ways in which skin, both animal and human, was conceptualised and used in Europe between 1450 and 1700, a period of enormous change in terms of global contacts and connections, and scientific innovation.</p>

     Modern Europe </li><li>Skin in the formation of professional medical expertise </li><li>Skin colour in early modern medicine </li><li>Early modern medical practitioners and practical structures of ''race-making''</li></ul><h4>Biography</h4><p>

</p><p>I am a
historian of early modern Europe, with expertise in
pre-modern science and medicine. I did my undergraduate degree in my home
country of Ireland (TCD), before heading to the States for a PhD in Berkeley,
where I was a Fulbright Scholar.  Before joining the Renaissance Skin
team, I was a Junior Research Fellow at Oriel College, Oxford. My interest in
early modern medicine revolves around the role it plays in creating modern
structures of authority. I've written about skin disease, pre-modern medical
expertise, artisans, and material texts. My most recent article in the Bulletin
of the History of Medicine centres on Jan Jessen and an early treatise on skin
disease. My first book, <i><a href="https://upittpress.org/books/9780822945604/">A New Order of Medicine: The Rise of Physicians in Reformation Nuremberg</a>, </i>recently appeared with the University of Pittsburgh Press and was the winner of
the <a href="https://www.rensoc.org.uk/funding-prizes/society-biennial-book-prize">2020 Society for Renaissance Studies Biennial Book Prize</a>. </p><h4>Research Summary</h4><p>As the lead researcher on the project, I take an interest in all
things 'skin'. In the earlier stages of our project, my work focused on the
medical culture of skin in Reformation Germany - how vernacular knowledge,
epidemic disease and changing scholarly practices contributed to a new focus on
skin disease. I have an article forthcoming on this subject in Bulletin for the
History of Medicine, and I am editing a collection of essays on "Skin in
Early Modern Medicine", featuring everything from leprosy to dog-mange.
More recently, I've begun to examine broad trends in European medical writers'
engagement with "Global Skins". 
This interest led to a major conference in September 2019. I'm currently
working on two article-length projects on this: one on the treatment of 'skin
before colour' in early dermatological treatises, the other on the
reconceptualization of "African" <i>materia medica</i> in the
sixteenth century. </p>

        <p data-block-key="3jrl2">Skin had a multiplicity of meanings in Renaissance Europe, where it was often seen as a mesh rather than a barrier. One example that illustrates this is when considering hair. In this period, hair was regarded as a vapour that hardened after passing through the pores of the scalp. And so, Renaissance treatises on skin included baldness, as well as pox, when discussing diseases.</p><p data-block-key="yptw0">The connections and divide between human and animal skin are also key to our understanding of how skin was characterised, leading to broader questions of what separated men and women from beasts.</p><p data-block-key="rvxui">The project explored</p><p data-block-key="aohr0"></p><ol><li data-block-key="lzcrb">The changing notions of human and animal skin in Europe between 1450 and 1700 through textual, material, and visual evidence;<br/></li><li data-block-key="m64hb">The ways in which human and animal skins were connected, differentiated, and displayed both morally and physically;<br/></li><li data-block-key="ike5q">The concepts of colour and complexion in an increasingly globalised world;<br/></li><li data-block-key="fsz4n">The relationship between diseases that disfigured the surfaces of the body, skin care, cosmetics, and clothing.<br/></li></ol><p data-block-key="g9a5n"></p><p data-block-key="p16zz"></p><p data-block-key="2u5io">The aim for our 5 years was to create an interdisciplinary, medical humanities approach to Renaissance skin (human and animal) in Europe, 1450-1700, and break down the divide between the study of human and animal skin diseases.</p><p data-block-key="ciuy4">We are keen to open conversation on our research and the material that we use, and so the <a href="../themes/">Themes</a> section is intended to serve as a portal into some of our findings. Here, under the categories of ‘Defining’, ‘Breaking’, ‘Living’, ‘Consuming’, ‘Protecting’, and ‘Misbehaving’, you will discover sources that we have found interesting and have helped to shape our thinking. Thumbnail images of the sources within each category appear to the right of the screen, allowing you to jump to a particular source, or you can simply explore them all by scrolling down through the page. Clicking on the main image of the source will pull up a larger version – allowing you to focus on the details – and from here you can scroll through each source in a linear fashion<br/></p><p data-block-key="2f2nc"></p>
