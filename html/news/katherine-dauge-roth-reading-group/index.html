    <p>For our reading group on 1 May 2020, we had the pleasure of
welcoming <a href="https://www.bowdoin.edu/profiles/faculty/kdauge/index.html">Dr
Katherine Dauge-Roth</a> from Bowdoin College, who discussed her
recent book, <a href="https://www.routledge.com/Signing-the-Body-Marks-on-Skin-in-Early-Modern-France-1st-Edition/author/p/book/9780754657729"><i>Signing
the Body: Marks on Skin in Early Modern France</i></a>.
The session, which took place on Zoom in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, was
attended by around 30 scholars from a broad variety of disciplines and generated
rich conversation about early modern skin marking practices.</p>

<p>In <i>Signing the Body</i>, Dauge-Roth addresses
the rich history of the marked body in the early modern period. Drawing on a
wide range of sources, she investigates the meanings of tattooing and marks on
skin in areas as diverse as demonology, jurisprudence, mysticism, medicine,
pilgrimage, commerce, travel and colonial conquest. In our virtual reading
group, Dauge-Roth focused in particular on the tattoos worn by European
pilgrims returning from the Holy Land. Dauge-Roth also addressed
this topic in one of our recent <a href="../../themes/living/#image_thumb166">blog posts</a>.</p>

<p>Through the lens of the pilgrim tattoo,
Dauge-Roth offered insights into the meanings that skin and skin markings were
ascribed within Christian context. The tattoos that European pilgrims brought
back from the Holy Land, typically in the form of the Jerusalem Cross, provided
material proof of their visit, permanently emblazoned on their skin. As an
embodiment of the trials endured during travels and a sort of self-imposed
<i>stigmata</i>, the pilgrim tattoo was understood as a form of <i>imitatio
Christi</i>, or the quest for physical proximity to Christ. The Jerusalem
tattoo therefore enabled pilgrims to inscribe both their physical and spiritual
journey upon the flesh and, as such, served as a sign of devotion and
distinction.</p>

<p>When describing the practice of tattooing
itself, pilgrims commonly made use of language borrowed from printing and drew parallels
between skin, paper, parchment and copper plates. Dauge-Roth therefore suggested
that the practice of tattooing was understood by early moderns as closely
affiliated with artisanal crafts. The practical dimensions of tattooing were extensively
explored in the ensuing conversation, alongside questions concerning the
origins, prevalence and mobility of pilgrim tattoos. Tattooing in Jerusalem had
its roots in Coptic Christian tradition and infrastructure; the involvement of
European pilgrims alone would not have supported its local economy. There is
evidence, however, that the practice of tattooing pilgrims spread beyond
Jerusalem to pilgrimage sites in Europe, such as Loretto. The designs used by
tattoo practitioners in the Holy Land travelled even further, across the
Atlantic, as the Jerusalem Cross found its way onto the skins of runaway
slaves. Despite this cross-cultural and cross-continental mobility, evidence
for tattoos on female pilgrims has been hard to find in European sources. The
question of women’s participation in the culture of tattooing more widely would
deserve greater attention.</p>

<p>Dauge-Roth’s work complicates
long-standing ideas about the history of tattooing in Europe, which is typically
associated with the voyages of James Cook or with penal purposes. The tattoo
was neither an eighteenth-century import to Europe carried on the skins of
sailors returning from the Pacific; nor was it a negative stigma that the
Graeco-Romans and other European cultures used to brand the bodies of criminals
and slaves. The practice of permanently marking the skin had a long and
intricate history in Europe, as skin provided the space for inscribing signs of
spirituality, piety and status as much as those of dishonour and punishment.</p>

<p>Therefore, before ever observing – and
‘othering’ – tattoos on indigenous bodies in the Americas and later the
Pacific, early modern Europeans developed complex discourses of skin marking. Still,
tattoo in early modern Europe held strong associations with travel. As a
permanent reminder of the body’s passage through physical and spiritual
landscapes, the pilgrim tattoo was a sign of its bearer’s displacement beyond
the ordinary experience of everyday life. In the words of Dr Dauge-Roth, just
“like the tattoo itself, inserted under the skin in a space in-between the
body’s interior and exterior, the traveller occupies a space in-between.”</p>
