    <p>The Renaissance Skin team headed to Toronto in balmy March
as locals cheerfully skated on the outdoor ice rink outside the conference
venue for the Renaissance Society of America’s annual meeting (17-19<sup>th</sup>
March 2019).</p>

<p>The Renaissance Skin panel was scheduled as one of the
second sessions of the last day (Tuesday). Since Hannah could not be there, our
colleague generously offered to read (and interpret very effectively) her paper
on a work of recent interest to the project - Jan Jessen's <i>De cute et cutaneis affectibus</i>. Although Jessen's text offered
little by way of innovation, it draws together a set of developments that
underpinned sixteenth century attitudes to skin. Her paper argued that skin
emerged as a disease category throughout the sixteenth century, and that this
was part of a broader shift within surgical and pharmaceutical approaches to
disease, which conceived of the body as matter, and was linked to new
procedures, treatments and ideas of the senses.</p><p>Paolo dug deep into the trial case of a 17<sup>th</sup>
century empiric surgeon from Pisa, Giovanni Battista Terrarossa. By using both static or normative documents (licenses,
official regulations, barber-surgeon’s manuals) and more dynamic sources (the
trial of Terrarossa), he asked what was an expert on skin diseases in this
period, and how the loose category of “skin diseases” came into being under the
influence of medical theory, surgical practice, patient demand, and civic
regulation of medical practice. He showed that by the late 17th century “skin
disease” became an independent category, the surface an independent object, and
the empiric surgeon an expert of surfaces. Human skin as a surface acquired
autonomy as an object of knowledge and practice; moreover, a class of experts
on this surface emerged at the same time following a path which was in large
measure independent from the transformations of Galenic medicine and the rise
of mechanistic medicine which are typically described as central in this
period.</p><p></p>

<p>Finally,
Kathleen addressed the specificity of dog skin in
medical treatises and why it would have been considered so appropriate to place
on human flesh, while also examining animal skin and its similarities and
divergences from human skin in a medical context. The use of dog skin gloves,
stockings, and girdles in treating assorting ailments from chilblains to gout
or as cosmetic devices appears in many sixteenth and seventeenth century
medical treatises. A major focus was a dog-skin birth girdle that appears in
surgical and midwifery texts (particularly Ambroise Paré, Jacques Guillemeau
and Louise Bourgeois). Soaked in ointment it was applied to the belly of a
pregnant woman to preserve the expanding skin underneath. The fact that the animal used for all these procedures is
a dog appears to be quite incidental. The importance is not the animal itself
but its disembodied skin, in particular: prepared tanned skin: flexible, soft,
thin, absorbent and this is attested in the language used in these texts. </p>

<p>The
panel was a success, and the full house asked several questions ranging from
dogs to surgical tools, producing a lively debate. We are grateful to all the
people who came to the panel and to our chair and sponsor Caroline Petit
(University of Warwick).</p>

<p>Among the many different sessions we attended, the session on Sunday
morning (17 March) ‘Saxa Loquuntur: Early Modern Geology and Mineralogy in
Latin’ was particularly helpful for the Renaissance Skin team. In this session,
three scholars from the Leopold-Franzens-Universität Innsbruck discussed
sixteenth-century geological texts (Dominik Berrens ‘Names and Things: The Case
of the<b> </b>Bermannus’, Martin Korenjak
‘The Taste of Stone: Descriptive Techniques in Conrad Gessner’s De rerum
fossilium figures’ and Irina Tautschnig’s Plane admirabile fossilium theatrum:
Promoting Mineralogy in the Seventeenth Century). Martin Korenjak’s paper
reminded us to look at the surface of rocks in the context of ‘skin’,
particularly when authors like Gessner’s attempted to describe them with
sensory and comparative methods. For Gessner geodes were like quail eggs (and
squealed when placed in water) while flurorites resembled goiters or
thunderstones resembled the horns of animals and smelled of burnt horn or cat
urine (!). The project’s Noscemus database (<a href="https://www.uibk.ac.at/projects/noscemus/database/">https://www.uibk.ac.at/projects/noscemus/database/</a>)
on early modern Latin scientific literature is a great scholarly tool.</p>

<p>The team members split up to attend several panels. While the stones
were talking, the first panel of a series titled “Patterns of Knowledge
Production in Early Modern Graphic Collections” was exploring ways in which
visual information could be translated into mostly written knowledge. Genevieve
Warwick (University of Edinburgh) spoke of how drawings were arranged into albums
in early modern Italy. Discussing exemplary cases as Giulio Mancini’s and
Cassiano dal Pozzo’s collections, she argued that “taccuini,” portable hybrids
of image and text, were true “research instruments”, which were treated as such
and kept in library as they were books. Irina Schmiedel, (Johannes Gutenberg
Universiät Mainz) intriguingly explored the visual analogies between family and
plant genealogies and showed how “portable galleries” contributed to the
formation of 17th century expertise in both human and natural history. Katherine
Reinhart (CRASSH, University of Cambridge) presented the <i>Making Visible project</i> she is part of and, starting from the famous
“scrapbook” (ms 131) of the Royal Society, she offered a broad overview of the
practice of collecting images of individual specimens, events, or objects for
epistemic purposes in early modern scientific academies. Distinguishing between
“explicit practice” (intentional collection of images) and “implicit practices”
(collective, later work of assembling images together) she also explored the
fate of collections of drawings in such institutions.</p>

<p>Other papers that day included Alexandra Marraccini’s (Warburg
Institute) ‘The Nautilus and the Pearl: Accretion and Motion in the English
Early Modern Collection’ (in the session ‘On Motion and Mobility: Mimesis,
Kinesis, and the Liveliness of Things’) which featured nautilus shells, a
subject of interest to us when thinking about animal coverings and surfaces.
The session ‘Botany, Astrology, and Pastoral in the Atlantic World’ included
Elizabeth Gansen’s paper ‘Monopolies of Knowledge: The Case of Vilasante’s New
Balsam in Oviedo’s Historia general (1535)’ which was an interesting case on
the measures to restrict knowledge of the New World Balsam tree in line with royal
monopolies on the plant in Santo Domingo.</p>

<p>Also on Sunday, Renaissance Skin has followed with great interest the
panel “Artistic Expertise and the Rhetoric of Knowledge, 1500–1650.” During
that session, Lisa Jordan (Kunsthistorisches Institut in Florenz,
Max-Planck-Institut) connected in a very interesting way anatomists,
draughtsmen, and surgeons, and explored the relationships between art and
surgery starting from a motto attributed by Guercino to the painter and surgeon
Ercole Gennari: “hands in the eyes, eyes in the hands.” Jordan argued that
painters and surgeons (and barber-surgeons) both manipulated the surface of
their materials, and had a common view of craftsmanship. Food for thought for
Renaissance Skin!</p>

<p>In the “Matters of Life and Death in Renaissance Health Care” panel on
Sunday afternoon Spirit-Rose Waite (University of Toronto) intriguingly
connected gender, bodily fluids, and textiles in her exploration of the
material culture of the Hospital of the Innocenti in Florence. Waite described
the use of menstrual cloths and emphasised the tactile tacit knowledge implied
in their use, production, and maintenance, thus offering an example of a bodily
technology and a way of managing female patients in the closed space of the
hospital. She also discussed swaddling clothes and how foundling inmates too
old for swaddling clothes would wear a piece of cloth pinned to their robes
that had the image of a swaddled child.</p>

    <p>Monday morning started with earthquakes. The first panel of a series
titled “Natural Disasters and Environmental Interventions in the Early Modern
World” opened with Monica Azzolini’s (University of Bologna) paper on Francisco
de Borja, saint and protector from earthquakes. Theology, history of
canonization, popular devotion, and natural philosophy, Azzolini presented a
case in which all these things mixed together: she inquired how the 16th
century Jesuit Borja, who lived in Rome most of his life and was canonized only
in 1670, became in the 17th century the patron saint of the city of Bogotá, in
the “new world,” and the protector from earthquakes, without the Roman curia
knowing it at first. Curiously, Borja was believed to heal both sick bodies and
the “sick” earth causing earthquakes – ever more connections between human and
earth surfaces.   </p>

<p>Papers on Monday also included Peter Pormann (Manchester)’s paper ‘Ibn
Serapion’s Practica as a Transcultural Text on Obstetrics’ (in the session
‘Contested Bodies: Pregnancy and Motherhood in the Middle Ages and Early Modern
Period’), which discussed the translations of the lost Syriac original (3 into
Arabic, 2 into Latin, and 1 into Hebrew from one of the Latin versions).
Pormann also discussed sources for ideas about uterine suffocation in Alpago
revision translation in the Renaissance. There were many papers of interest in
the two sessions on Disease and Disability in the Renaissance. Erin Travers
(University of California, Santa Barbara) paper ‘Constructing a Corpus:
Anatomical Exemplars in Seventeenth-Century Dutch Art Literature’ focused on  Jacob van de Gracht taking examples from
anatomical atlases and modifying them to enable the study of anatomy by artists
. Caterina Agostini, Rutgers University–New Brunswick paper ‘Art in the Time of
Syphilis: A Medical Narrative in Benvenuto Cellini's Works‘ examined how
Cellini recorded epidemics. Brian Nance’s 
(Coastal Carolina University) paper The Imaginary Pauper: Wealth,
Charity, and Petrus Forestus' Treatment of Delusional Melancholia zoomed in on
one case in Forestus’ <i>Medical
Observations </i>concerning a rich Delft merchant and Forestus attempts to
educate his patients and persuade them (and their families) that his diagnosis
was legitimate.</p>

<p>Tuesday was a plethora of medical session. It started with ‘Medicine,
Books, and Herbs: Pharmacology in Renaissance Europe’. Caroline Petit
(University of Warwick) paper ‘Galen's Treatises on Pharmacology and Their
Readership in Sixteenth-Century Europe’ on Renaissance translations on sections
of Galen’s copious <i>On Simples Drugs</i>.
Apart from the Latin translations and Greek editions (in particular the
translations by the Polish physician Josephus Struthius), she focused on French
translations destined to be read by barber surgeons and the role Jean Canappe
in widening access to these texts.</p>

<p>Barbara Di Gennaro’s (Yale University) Theriac in Print Culture
(1497–1800) was an overview of her quantitative research project, mapping
theriac titles (1497-1800) in order to understand literary trends, readership
of pharmaceutical knowledge and relationship to medical practice. This great
session ended with Ilaria Andreoli’s (Centre national de la recherche
scientifique) paper on  Pietro Andrea
Mattioli's <i>Discorsi </i>on Dioscorides:
The Publishing Strategies behind a Renaissance Bestseller. Mattioli’s ‘update’
of Dioscorides (adding around 100 more plants) became the standard reference
book of medical botany of second half of 16<sup>th</sup> century and was a huge
best seller, with the publisher even having to deal with the trouble of pirate
editions. </p>

    <p>The very medical day concluded with ‘Technologies of Health, 1400–1700’,
This included Sharon Strocchia’s (Emory University) paper ‘Fare la prova: The
Use of Human Subjects in Renaissance Drug Trials’ which looked at at tests
using of human subjects conducted for purpose of patented medicines in major
Italian states. Subjects included prisoners, soldiers in state employment and
hospital patients. It was a case of medical innovation driven by commercial
consideration and mediated by structures of power. Danielle Abdon (Temple
University) paper ‘Visual and Structural Purification: Controlling Dead Bodies
and Waste in Renaissance Hospitals’ focused on Renaissance hospital
architecture at Lisbon’s Hospital Real de Todos-os-Santos and how contemporary
ideas of poor relief affected architecture. Katherine M. Bentz (Saint Anselm
College) gave a paper on ‘Scamozzi's Guide for Healthy Living: The Gallery in
Early Modern Italy’ which discusses the construction and use of galleries and
loggias as spaces to promote healthy living and walking.</p>

<p>Kathleen also visited the Bata Shoe Museum, The Textile
Museum, and the Royal Ontario Museum (nautilus cups a plenty), looking out for
potential project sources. The exhibition ‘Art and Innovation: Traditional
Arctic Footwear from the Bata Shoe Museum Collection afforded so many
opportunities to look at the use of animal skin by indigenous communities in
the Arctic. Most notable was a parka made by a Yup’ik seamstress of seal
intestine, which weighed less than 200 grams and had excellent wind and water
repelling properties. Nearly everything in the exhibition was constructed from
animal fur or leather, often specifically harnessing the qualities of a particular
part of the animal, such as shoes with soles made from the skin between a
reindeer’s foot to allow for better traction when walking on ice. </p>
