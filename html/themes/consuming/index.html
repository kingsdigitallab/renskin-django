<div class="page-content">
    
    
    <p>This panel of an animal skin is 26.6 cm x 26.6 cm. It was embroidered by either Mary, Queen of
Scots, or Elizabeth Talbot, Countess of Shrewsbury, using a linen canvas with silk
threads between 1570 and 1585. The animal is named incorrectly by the V&amp;A as a civet cat; it is rather the skin of a common genet (<i>Genetta genetta</i>).</p><p><br/></p><p>The animal can be identified by an inscription to the surface of the object, which reads ‘A GENE SKYN’. The image seems to be based on the woodcut of a genet’s skin that appears in the monumental <i>Historia animalium</i> (Book I <i>De quadrupedibus viviparis</i>, Zurich, 1551) and in the abbreviated <i>Icones animalium</i> (1553), works by the Swiss physician and natural
philosopher Conrad Gessner.  For
Gessner, genets had the nature of a cat and a shape resembling a weasel. He
cites Gerolamo Cardano (1501-1576), regarding the genet as having ‘more noble’ fur
(along with the lynx) and that this fur was black and ash-coloured, with many distinct spots.</p><p><br/></p><p>Gessner noted that he himself had seen had seen the skin of a genet,
which was, from the head to the top of the tail, the length four dodrans (3/4 of a
foot) and one palm, with the tail being two dodrans. He could see eight black
circles on this particular specimen’s tail, along with white and grey patches. It was
possible to discern ‘very elegant’ black spots all over the body. Gessner also remarked on the very good smell of the skin, which smelled like musk. Considering
its size, the spots, and its nature, Gessner judged the animal to be a kind of
small panther.<br/></p><p><br/></p><p>The skins were imported from Spain via Lyons and used for
precious garments, imbued with an agreeable scent. Mary, Queen of Scots, also used Gessner woodcuts as the model for
another embroidery of an animal, that of a cat (‘A catte’, Royal Collection
Trust. RCIN 28224).</p><p><br/></p><p>KWM</p><p><br/></p><p>Further Reading:</p><p></p><ul><li>Conrad Gesner, <i>Historia animalium: De

<div class="page-content">
    
    
    <p>In this portrait by Paolo Veronese, the Countess Livia da Porto Thiene has her <i>zibellino</i> draped over her right arm. This accessory made of weasel fur has a jewelled gold head, which is attached to the girdle around Livia's waist. In addition  to the sable fur of the zibellino, Livia's cloak is lined with lynx fur.</p><p><br/></p><p>The fur of many members of the weasel family (<i>Mustelidae</i>), including martens,
stoats, mink, and sable, were highly prized in early modern Europe. Women in the sixteenth-century were accustomed to draping a single whole pelt (complete with the head and front and back
paws) over their shoulders or their arm. The head was sometimes replaced
with a high-quality replica made of metal or glass, such as the gem-set and enamelled gold weasel head seen
below. The animal’s nose would often be pierced with
a ring, which would be attached by a chain to the wearer’s waist. These highly valued accessories, known as <i>zibellini</i>, are prevalent in portraiture,
inventories, accounts, lists of dowry payments, and other written documents. The
pelt was customarily purchased from a furrier and taken to a jeweller, who would then add the chain or head if desired.</p>

    <p>The weasel has long been associated with childbirth. In Ovid’s <i>Metamorphosis</i>, the goddess Juno transforms Galanthis (the maid of Alcmena, mother of Hercules) into a weasel, condemned to give birth through her mouth. Bestiaries and popular texts on animals in the medieval and early modern period informed the reader that weasels conceived either through their ears or mouths and gave birth through either of these orifices. The <i>zibellino</i> may have thus been conceived as an amulet for easy childbirth, making it ideal as a gift for young brides. In addition to its symbolic value, the <i>zibellino</i> was a marker of wealth and status, very often made of valuable high-quality fur and precious materials. One such example is the <i>zibellino</i> imported into London by the Italian merchant Cristoforo Carcano in 1544: ‘one martron skynne with the head and claws of gold, the head garnished with iii emeralds, ii diamonds and iii rubies. A carcan of gold garnished with iiii great table diamonds, iiii great rocke rubies, viii great pearls and a pearl pendant, a chain, a girdle, two crosses and two rings’.</p><p><br/></p><p>KWM</p><p><br/></p><p>Further Reading:</p><p></p><ul><li>Tawny Sherrill, 'Fleas,

    <p>The weasel has long been associated with childbirth. In Ovid’s <i>Metamorphosis</i>, the goddess Juno transforms Galanthis (the maid of Alcmena, mother of Hercules) into a weasel, condemned to give birth through her mouth. Bestiaries and popular texts on animals in the medieval and early modern period informed the reader that weasels conceived either through their ears or mouths and gave birth through either of these orifices. The <i>zibellino</i> may have thus been conceived as an amulet for easy childbirth, making it ideal as a gift for young brides. In addition to its symbolic value, the <i>zibellino</i> was a marker of wealth and status, very often made of valuable high-quality fur and precious materials. One such example is the <i>zibellino</i> imported into London by the Italian merchant Cristoforo Carcano in 1544: ‘one martron skynne with the head and claws of gold, the head garnished with iii emeralds, ii diamonds and iii rubies. A carcan of gold garnished with iiii great table diamonds, iiii great rocke rubies, viii great pearls and a pearl pendant, a chain, a girdle, two crosses and two rings’.</p><p><br/></p><p>KWM</p><p><br/></p><p>Further Reading:</p><p></p><ul><li>Tawny Sherrill, 'Fleas,

    <p>This cylindrical, sewn, leather bottle is known as costrel, or
pilgrim flask, which was a small, barrel-shaped flask or bottle most frequently
used to carry beer or water. The opening at the top allowed liquid to be poured
in or out of the vessel and the two lug holes on either side of the neck would
have held a strap by which to carry the bottle. Surviving examples can also be
found in ceramic or stoneware, but leather was an ideal material for this type
of portable flask as it was light yet strong and, crucially, waterproof.</p><p><br/></p>

<p>This seventeenth-century example is held by the National
Leather Collection and is typical of costrels of the period. The stopper is no longer present,
but it is likely that it would have been made of wood. The body of the vessel
is made from <i>cuir bouilli</i>, meaning
that the tanned hide was treated in wax and immersed in boiling water to render it tough, rigid, and waterproof. Still wet, the leather was placed around a cylindrical form and allowed
to dry, before two disks were stitched at each end using thread that had been soaked in
wax or animal fat. Some examples have additional leather bindings to reinforce
the seams. The initials ‘TH’ have been tooled
into the leather just below the neck of the flask. It is possible that these are the initials of the bottle’s owner but, given the wide circulation of these types of flask, it probably had more than one
owner. The body of the flask is
stamped with star-shaped marks arranged to form tessellating diamonds.</p><p><br/></p>

<p>Extant costrels from this period are remarkably consistent
in form and appear to have similar proportions, suggesting that their production
was standardised to hold a specific measure of liquid. This may have been for tax purposes, as the first tax on beer was introduced by Cromwell’s regime in
1643. Many thousands of these bottles
were made in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, but they were less
prevalent in the eighteenth century, probably due to the increased availability
of porcelain vessels imported from China. However, there is anecdotal evidence
to suggest that these leather costrels remained popular on board the ships that brought porcelain
to England, as a flask made of leather was not liable to break if it was dropped when
the ships were buffeted by stormy seas.</p><p><br/></p><p>JC</p><p><br/></p><p>Image: Leather costrel, 17th century, National Leather Collection, Northampton</p>

                      <h3>Leather Wall Decorations</h3> <p>

<div class="page-content">
    
    
    <p>Works of leather and objects made from animal skin were
ubiquitous in the early modern period. Across Europe, guilds and companies of leatherworkers controlled trade and took responsibility for transmitting the
practical know-how to their members. Leather was not only used for clothes and
furniture, but characteristically, it was turned into complex wall decorations,
often 'engraved' with special gold and silver 'inks'.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>In June 2018, the Renaissance Skin team visited the Museo del tessuto e della tappezzeria Vittorio Zironi in Bologna. Only recently reopened, it holds a vast collection of textiles, works of leather, and related tools and
machinery. Amongst the highlights of the collection are the 17<sup>th</sup>-century
leather wall decorations and – unique for this material – the
moulds used to stamp drawings and decorations upon them (see main image).</p><p><br/></p><p>In the
late 16<sup>th</sup> century, polymath Tommaso Garzoni wrote a detailed

    <p>Garzoni then turns to providing an actual
description of the technique. In particular, he praises the skills of those who
made 'golden leather'. Spain is the place where the best leatherworkers live,
but the author also mentions the Neapolitans. First of all, they wash the skin
and they gently tan them (2:1038-39): 'They use those skins that shoemakers use
to line the shoes; these skins need to be smooth and clean, with no traces of
fur'. The skins are placed in a water basin for one night, 'and then they are
beaten up on a smooth stone'; the skins are washed again, and the remaining
water is squeezed out. 'After having done all this, leatherworkers place the
skin on a large smooth stone and stretch it with a special iron tool, before
drying it very carefully. Then they place a certain glue made with pieces of
parchment paper on the skin [...] in order to cover it all before hanging it to
dry'. The skin is then nailed to a wooden table to dry some more and placed
upon the stone again, where it is 'burnished with a burnisher made of <i>lapis ematitis</i> [an iron-like mineral
used in cosmetics and in metallurgy] that makes it shiny and beautiful'.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Once the artisans have done this,
they must have at hand a mould carved in a drawing table, with which the
leather must be worked by using a special ink made with a resin solvent and
gold or silver powder. The skin must be placed on the mould (<i>la stampa</i>) to be printed and dried. Once
it is dry it must be placed on wooden tables where it is gilded. Then, with a
knife, the mould must be removed. Finally, the pieces of skin can be cut and
sewn together: 'and the work is done'.</p>

<div class="page-content">
    
    
    <p>Works of leather and objects made from animal skin were
ubiquitous in the early modern period. Across Europe, guilds and companies of leatherworkers controlled trade and took responsibility for transmitting the
practical know-how to their members. Leather was not only used for clothes and
furniture, but characteristically, it was turned into complex wall decorations,
often 'engraved' with special gold and silver 'inks'.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>In June 2018, the Renaissance Skin team visited the Museo del tessuto e della tappezzeria Vittorio Zironi in Bologna. Only recently reopened, it holds a vast collection of textiles, works of leather, and related tools and
machinery. Amongst the highlights of the collection are the 17<sup>th</sup>-century
leather wall decorations and – unique for this material – the
moulds used to stamp drawings and decorations upon them (see main image).</p><p><br/></p><p>In the
late 16<sup>th</sup> century, polymath Tommaso Garzoni wrote a detailed
description of the art and techniques of the 'masters of leatherwork' (<i>maestri di corami</i>), by then a
professional group distinct enough to earn an entry in Garzoni’s encyclopaedia
of professions. Garzoni began his description by recalling the
ambiguous and potentially polluting world of skin and leatherworkers: this is a

                      <h3>Perfumed Hands &amp; Gloves in Protestant Germany</h3> <p>

<div class="page-content">
    
    
    <p>Exploring the material and olfactory world of
Renaissance skin, this post is an appetiser for an article that I have been
working on for a while now.</p><p>In the 16th and 17th centuries, head and facial
hair, as well as skin, were intrinsically linked with scented matter. Faces and
hands were treated with medicinal and cosmetic remedies; and perfumed
accessories and textiles such as gloves, jewellery (including buttons) and the
like became highly popular, shaping what Evelyn Welch has termed the ‘olfactory
imprints’ of early modern individuals.</p><p><br/></p><p>Recently, historians have sparked debate on the role
of such scented materials, revealing, for example, the astonishing significance
of perfumed gloves in early modern Italy and England. In Elizabethan London, artisans
invested considerable effort in fostering and maintaining international
networks for acquiring the materials needed for perfuming gloves. A similarly
burgeoning exchange of scented accessories took place between Italy and Spain
in the 16th century. In particular, Welch’s research has shown that
‘a plethora of new forms of perfumed accessories […] were widely distributed
across Europe in the second half of the sixteenth century’. Surprisingly, Reformation
Germany remains still a blank spot on the map of early modern European scented
matter.<br/></p><p><br/></p><p>This is even more surprising given the fascinating
archival material that awaits its discovery by historians who study the world
of matter and its relationship with the body and the senses. For instance, the
court of Duke Ernest I of Saxe-Gotha (1640-75) invested regularly in
‘well-scented gloves’ (<i>wolriechende Handschue</i>) that were worn by the Duke, his wife Elisabeth
Sophie, and his daughters Elisabeth Dorothea and Dorothea Maria. Such
accessories were bought routinely at both rather reasonable and quite expensive
cost in Erfurt and Nuremberg. Here, merchants, grocers, tanners, bag-makers,
and glove-makers all had specialised their businesses in the manufacturing,
perfuming, and selling of gloves (see main image). On at least one occasion, in
August 1641, Duke Ernest purchased three pairs of perfumed gloves for the
duchess. She returned the favour when she bought similarly perfumed gloves for
her husband in 1673. It
would also seem that ‘well-scented gloves’ were popular Christmas presents
given to the young princes and princesses at the Gotha court. From these references we can see that perfumed gloves
were also highly sought-after products in Protestant Germany.</p>

</div>
    
    
    
    <p><br/></p><p>Yet there is much more to say than merely about their popularity, since the sources give considerable detail on the fragrances of the gloves. Just a month before Duke Ernest was about to die, he commissioned ‘a pair of black perfumed mourning gloves’ to be purchased. These seem to have been infused with special odours. In a period that considered the body porous and unstable, scents like those containing musk were considered to animate the heart and the vital spirits, yet similar fragrances could also create the ‘right’ atmosphere to prepare for death or mourning loss. To maintain the desired scents of these textiles, the goods were stored in tiny chests (<i>kästlein</i>), the costs of which are likewise recorded in the sources. Gloves perfumed in the ‘Roman’ manner seemed to have been particularly popular in Lutheran Gotha.</p><p><br/></p><p>What it actually meant to desire, prepare, and wear perfumed gloves is
well documented for another Protestant milieu. Several recipes for perfuming
gloves and, for instance, ‘to make a pleasant-tasting water for the face,
hands, and gloves’ survive from the personal collection of the Lutheran Elector Palatine Louis VI
(1576–83) (see image). The recipes reveal the efforts that were invested in producing
the scents and in treating the textiles. Both domestic and foreign plants,
fruits, resins, oils, herbs, and lards were processed and applied to achieve,
for example, a ‘deliciously lovely or semi-sweet (<i>lieblichenn</i>) flavour and scent’. According to the recipes, many olfactory
treatments attracted the nose as much as the palate. To accomplish such precious
sensory experiences, ingredients of German, French, Italian, and even Mediterranean
origin were processed.</p>

</div>
    
    
    
    <p>In order to fully understand the material dynamics of
the sensory world of hands and their textile accessories, for a while now I have
been engaged in remaking the 16th-century recipes of the Elector Palatine
Louis VI (see image). I hope that future remaking experiments I intend to conduct
with students from the University of Manchester will contribute
further to exploring this topic. Particularly fascinating is the way in which
recipes for perfumed textiles interacted with cosmetic recipes for hands. We
read in one set of instructions for whiter hands how you should ‘take lemon juice with a bit of dried and ground salt’.
You should then ‘wash your hands with this and let them dry off by themselves.
It removes all spots, blemishes, and damages’. Considering the myriad of lemons
that the court apothecary of Gotha purchased in Erfurt, cosmetic remedies of
this kind also seem to have had medicinal implications that further correspond
with the appearance of accessories and textiles. Duke Ernest owned a
brown-coloured coat which was embroidered with gold and silver threads and
prepared with ‘lemon-coloured velvet’. Another coat, likewise embroidered with
gold and silver, was padded with ‘peach-coloured plush’. Referencing fruits
when wearing, seeing, and describing textiles surely also communicated the very
sensory qualities like fragrance or taste that fruits were associated with. This
is even more compelling since such textiles referencing fruits actively
interacted with the skin and other cloths that were treated and decorated with
the very same fruits and flowers. Golden and silver roses – maybe themselves
perfumed – were sewn into one of the doublets of Ernest, whose wardrobe also comprised
another ‘perfumed leather doublet’ as well as ‘perfumed furs’. All this moulded together the olfactory regimes of skins and the textiles and accessories surrounding
them.</p><p><br/></p>

    <p><br/></p><p>We read in another recipe from 16th-century Heidelberg that ‘to make
hands white’ chalk should first be seethed and then ground down before being
mixed with three or four egg whites of particularly white appearance. Around
30 grams of mastic – a yellowish resin taken from the mastic tree in Chios
– and 15 grams of camphor were added to the paste, which was mixed,
distilled, and finally concocted (see video). Remaking such recipes from early
modern Protestant Germany made me realise why they were called an ‘art’ (<i>kunst</i>).</p><p></p><p></p>

    <p><br/></p><p>Yet there is much more to say than merely about their popularity, since the sources give considerable detail on the fragrances of the gloves. Just a month before Duke Ernest was about to die, he commissioned ‘a pair of black perfumed mourning gloves’ to be purchased. These seem to have been infused with special odours. In a period that considered the body porous and unstable, scents like those containing musk were considered to animate the heart and the vital spirits, yet similar fragrances could also create the ‘right’ atmosphere to prepare for death or mourning loss. To maintain the desired scents of these textiles, the goods were stored in tiny chests (<i>kästlein</i>), the costs of which are likewise recorded in the sources. Gloves perfumed in the ‘Roman’ manner seemed to have been particularly popular in Lutheran Gotha.</p><p><br/></p><p>What it actually meant to desire, prepare, and wear perfumed gloves is
well documented for another Protestant milieu. Several recipes for perfuming
gloves and, for instance, ‘to make a pleasant-tasting water for the face,
hands, and gloves’ survive from the personal collection of the Lutheran Elector Palatine Louis VI
(1576–83) (see image). The recipes reveal the efforts that were invested in producing
the scents and in treating the textiles. Both domestic and foreign plants,
fruits, resins, oils, herbs, and lards were processed and applied to achieve,
for example, a ‘deliciously lovely or semi-sweet (<i>lieblichenn</i>) flavour and scent’. According to the recipes, many olfactory
treatments attracted the nose as much as the palate. To accomplish such precious
sensory experiences, ingredients of German, French, Italian, and even Mediterranean
origin were processed.</p>

    <p>In order to fully understand the material dynamics of
the sensory world of hands and their textile accessories, for a while now I have
been engaged in remaking the 16th-century recipes of the Elector Palatine
Louis VI (see image). I hope that future remaking experiments I intend to conduct
with students from the University of Manchester will contribute
further to exploring this topic. Particularly fascinating is the way in which
recipes for perfumed textiles interacted with cosmetic recipes for hands. We
read in one set of instructions for whiter hands how you should ‘take lemon juice with a bit of dried and ground salt’.
You should then ‘wash your hands with this and let them dry off by themselves.
It removes all spots, blemishes, and damages’. Considering the myriad of lemons
that the court apothecary of Gotha purchased in Erfurt, cosmetic remedies of
this kind also seem to have had medicinal implications that further correspond
with the appearance of accessories and textiles. Duke Ernest owned a
brown-coloured coat which was embroidered with gold and silver threads and
prepared with ‘lemon-coloured velvet’. Another coat, likewise embroidered with
gold and silver, was padded with ‘peach-coloured plush’. Referencing fruits
when wearing, seeing, and describing textiles surely also communicated the very
sensory qualities like fragrance or taste that fruits were associated with. This
is even more compelling since such textiles referencing fruits actively
interacted with the skin and other cloths that were treated and decorated with
the very same fruits and flowers. Golden and silver roses – maybe themselves
perfumed – were sewn into one of the doublets of Ernest, whose wardrobe also comprised
another ‘perfumed leather doublet’ as well as ‘perfumed furs’. All this moulded together the olfactory regimes of skins and the textiles and accessories surrounding
them.</p><p><br/></p>

hands white’ chalk should first be seethed and then ground down before being
mixed with three or four egg whites of particularly white appearance. Around
30 grams of mastic – a yellowish resin taken from the mastic tree in Chios
– and 15 grams of camphor were added to the paste, which was mixed,
distilled, and finally concocted (see video). Remaking such recipes from early
modern Protestant Germany made me realise why they were called an ‘art’ (<i>kunst</i>).</p><p></p><p></p>

                      <h3>Dotting with Kingfisher Blue</h3> <p>

<div class="page-content">
    
    
    <p>As a substitute
for pigments and mineral colours such as turquoise and lapis lazuli, the kingfisher
feather was overwhelmingly desired and consumed in China for over 2,000 years. The
name ‘kingfisher blue’ refers to the iridescent bluish, sometimes turquoise,
colour produced by the intricate structural arrangement of the feather from
certain subspecies of the <i>Alcedinidae </i>family.
This includes the common kingfisher (<i>Alcedo
atthis</i>), the white-throated kingfisher (<i>Halcyon
smyrnensis</i>), and the oriental dwarf kingfisher (<i>Ceyx erithaca</i>). Valued as a precious item, the kingfisher feather was
extremely difficult to obtain, and its transportation involved transregional
and even transnational logistics and supply chains.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Kingfishers
could not be bred, and they could die easily if taken from their natural habitat. Some
species could be found in areas of southern China, such as Sichuan, Guangxi,
Yunnan, and Hainan, yet the supply of raw feathers relied heavily on imports
from those South Asian countries and vassal states which had tribute relations
with China. Chenla (Cambodia), Luohu and Siam (Thailand), Jiaozhi (Annam),
Chiem Thanh, Trincomalee (Sri Lanka), and Bengal, for example, were recorded as
major suppliers.</p>

    </div>

    <p>In Qing China, Siam contributed a large number of feathers. In 1663, ‘Siam sent tributes on the occasion of the [Kangxi] Emperor’s birthday, which included […] six hundred pieces of kingfisher feather; tributes to the empress in the same year included […] three hundred pieces of kingfisher feather.’ (<i>General History of Guangzhou</i>, 1730, vol. 58). Compiled between 1750 and 1761 under the commission of the Qianlong Emperor (r.1735-1796), the <i>Album of Birds</i> reveals that kingfishers from Siam reached the court and were integral to Qing knowledge of distant worlds (see figure).<br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Together with precious frontier goods such as rhinoceros horn, fur, shark skin, peacock feather, red coral, and ambergris (grey amber), kingfisher feather was considered as a ‘local product’ from the barbaric regions. As such, its delivery, distribution, and use were central to the maintenance of China's tribute system. Despite a limited number of illegal imports dispersed throughout the market, kingfisher feather was consumed and disseminated mainly within court circles and so established connections with Han Chinese royalty. </p><p> </p><p>The making of kingfisher inlay, called ‘dotting with kingfisher blue’ (<i>diancui</i>), is a complicated metalworking technique. The full process moves from feather selection, cleaning, trimming, gluing, inlaying, and finally to the application of additional embellishments (Wong, ‘Kingfisher Blue in Ming Arts’, p.147). As the natural product varied in quality, only a small percentage of collected feathers – the so-called <i>ruancui</i> (literally the soft-blue, down feathers) plucked from a kingfisher’s back – was considered useful. At best, each bird could only contribute 28 feathers. Unlike multi-angular gemstones, kingfisher feathers have a flat surface. With the use of fish or bone glue, each trimmed feather was pasted onto metal inlays of accessories and imperial wares to accentuate the vibrant colours of gold, pearls, and other precious stones. </p><p> </p><p>Kingfisher feather was not only considered as a luxury item, but also as an identity-conferring material. The nomadic people to the north of the Great Wall rarely had access to this material until the Manchus conquered China in 1644. Manchu noblewomen were aware of the feather’s close association with Han Chinese royalty. The rustic <i>Baotou</i> hairstyle (literally meaning ‘wrapped heads’) was characterised by being devoid of any hair accessories apart from Manchurian freshwater pearls, but these were soon replaced by opulent hairpins dotted with shining kingfisher blue. In the Qing imperial workshop, the production of kingfisher inlay was established no later than the third decade of the eighteenth century. </p><p><br/></p>

                              <h3>Dotting with Kingfisher Blue</h3> 

<div class="page-content">
    
    
    <p>As a substitute
for pigments and mineral colours such as turquoise and lapis lazuli, the kingfisher
feather was overwhelmingly desired and consumed in China for over 2,000 years. The
name ‘kingfisher blue’ refers to the iridescent bluish, sometimes turquoise,
colour produced by the intricate structural arrangement of the feather from
certain subspecies of the <i>Alcedinidae </i>family.
This includes the common kingfisher (<i>Alcedo
atthis</i>), the white-throated kingfisher (<i>Halcyon
smyrnensis</i>), and the oriental dwarf kingfisher (<i>Ceyx erithaca</i>). Valued as a precious item, the kingfisher feather was
extremely difficult to obtain, and its transportation involved transregional
and even transnational logistics and supply chains.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Kingfishers
could not be bred, and they could die easily if taken from their natural habitat. Some
species could be found in areas of southern China, such as Sichuan, Guangxi,
Yunnan, and Hainan, yet the supply of raw feathers relied heavily on imports
from those South Asian countries and vassal states which had tribute relations
with China. Chenla (Cambodia), Luohu and Siam (Thailand), Jiaozhi (Annam),
Chiem Thanh, Trincomalee (Sri Lanka), and Bengal, for example, were recorded as
major suppliers.</p>

    <p>In Qing China, Siam contributed a large number of feathers. In 1663, ‘Siam sent tributes on the occasion of the [Kangxi] Emperor’s birthday, which included […] six hundred pieces of kingfisher feather; tributes to the empress in the same year included […] three hundred pieces of kingfisher feather.’ (<i>General History of Guangzhou</i>, 1730, vol. 58). Compiled between 1750 and 1761 under the commission of the Qianlong Emperor (r.1735-1796), the <i>Album of Birds</i> reveals that kingfishers from Siam reached the court and were integral to Qing knowledge of distant worlds (see figure).<br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Together with precious frontier goods such as rhinoceros horn, fur, shark skin, peacock feather, red coral, and ambergris (grey amber), kingfisher feather was considered as a ‘local product’ from the barbaric regions. As such, its delivery, distribution, and use were central to the maintenance of China's tribute system. Despite a limited number of illegal imports dispersed throughout the market, kingfisher feather was consumed and disseminated mainly within court circles and so established connections with Han Chinese royalty. </p><p> </p><p>The making of kingfisher inlay, called ‘dotting with kingfisher blue’ (<i>diancui</i>), is a complicated metalworking technique. The full process moves from feather selection, cleaning, trimming, gluing, inlaying, and finally to the application of additional embellishments (Wong, ‘Kingfisher Blue in Ming Arts’, p.147). As the natural product varied in quality, only a small percentage of collected feathers – the so-called <i>ruancui</i> (literally the soft-blue, down feathers) plucked from a kingfisher’s back – was considered useful. At best, each bird could only contribute 28 feathers. Unlike multi-angular gemstones, kingfisher feathers have a flat surface. With the use of fish or bone glue, each trimmed feather was pasted onto metal inlays of accessories and imperial wares to accentuate the vibrant colours of gold, pearls, and other precious stones. </p><p> </p><p>Kingfisher feather was not only considered as a luxury item, but also as an identity-conferring material. The nomadic people to the north of the Great Wall rarely had access to this material until the Manchus conquered China in 1644. Manchu noblewomen were aware of the feather’s close association with Han Chinese royalty. The rustic <i>Baotou</i> hairstyle (literally meaning ‘wrapped heads’) was characterised by being devoid of any hair accessories apart from Manchurian freshwater pearls, but these were soon replaced by opulent hairpins dotted with shining kingfisher blue. In the Qing imperial workshop, the production of kingfisher inlay was established no later than the third decade of the eighteenth century. </p><p><br/></p>

                      <h3>Furs for Earls</h3> <p>

<div class="page-content">
    
    
    <p>A detailed inventory was drawn up in 1561 for William Herbert, 1<sup>st</sup>
Earl of Pembroke (1506/7-1570) listing all his moveable goods, from the many
chairs in various properties to a ‘unicorns bone sett in golde with one turkois,
two rubies and iii diamonde’. The manuscript is held in the collections of the
National Art Library at the V&amp;A (MSL/1982/30).</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Within the inventory appears a list of his vast wardrobe, titled ‘An
inventory of all suche apparel, furres and jewelles as be in the charge of
Thomas Gregory, the xvii<sup>th </sup>of August anno domini 1561’ (f.38r). The
list is dominated by luxurious fabrics such as velvets, silks, satins, damasks,
and taffetas. They were decorated with lace, pearls, aglets, and gold or
enamelled buttons. Most of the outerwear is lined with expensive (and usually
imported) furs. In fact, it is often noted in the inventory when these garments
are not lined. So we read, ‘Item a night gowne of chaungeable taffeta, trimmed
with parcement lace of chaungeable silke and golde, without furre or lyninge’
(f. 38v). Sometimes, two types of fur may be used, as in the case of the
garment that is lined with squirrel fur and edged with sable fur. The following
list of references are ordered by the main lining used under the respective
animal fur.</p><p><br/></p>

<p><b>Sable</b></p>

<p>Sable is a species of marten (<i>Martes
zibellina</i>) that was famed for its soft dark-brown or black fur, a quality
that was noted by Edward Topsell in his <i>History
of four-footed beasts </i>(1607): The only price and estimation of this beast
is for the skin, which farre excelleth all the skins of the World […] if you
stroke them from the head to the tail, or on the contrary from the tail to the
head, they do lie every way smooth’. Sables were imported from Russia and were
the most expensive of furs.  According to
Jacob Ziegler (d. 1549), their price  had
'growne to great excess, next unto gold and precious stones'.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Pembroke’s sable garments included:</p>

<p></p><ul><li>Item a longe gowne of blacke satten with longe
sleves garded with blacke velvet, with ii weltes of velvet on bothe the sides
of the garde, laide between upon the garde, with blacke satten and lace of
blacke silke, with xliii buttons of golde and iii pearles on every button, furred
throughout with sables (f.38r)<br/></li><li>Item a longe gowne of blacke damaske with a
garde of velvet and a welte of velvet on either side of the garde, laide upon
with a pomell lace of silke purled on the’one side, sett with viii greate
buttons of golde with iii perles in every button, blacke, grene and blewe enamelled,
furred with sables (f.38r)<br/></li><li>Item a gowne of blacke satten with ii gardes of
blacke velvet passed through with satten and silke lace and laied overthwarte

    <p><b>Lynx</b><br/></p><p>Lynx was among the most expensive of furs to purchase in the sixteenth century. It was also one of the most distinctive, with its thick, spotted fur. The lynx has two coats: a short, reddish summer coat, and a thick grey-brownish winter coat. The latter was most valued for garments and, like sable, was imported from Russia. Pembroke owned two garments made with lynx fur, which was called <i>lucerne</i>. </p><p></p><ul><li>Item a gowne of blewe velvet with v weltes of the same and blewe silke and silver lace purled on every side with iiii dosen golde buttons enamelled white and blewe called pawnses, furred throughout with lusernes (f.40v)<br/></li><li>Item a gowne of russet satten with ii plaine gardes of velvet, fringed on every side and a lace of blacke silke upon the garde, sett with two dosen viii paire of greate aglettes full of pearles and furred throughe out with lusarnes (f.40v)<br/></li></ul><p></p><p><b>Squirrel</b><br/></p><p>Pembroke owned many garments lined with squirrel fur, which were often edged with other furs such as sable, wolf, or rabbit. The winter fur of red squirrels was most valued, in particular the soft, white belly fur and the dark, almost black, grey coat. The squirrel fur in this inventory is termed <i>calabre</i> (derived from the place name Calabria), however by this period it did not refer only to Italian squirrel skins but also to squirrel skins from Central Europe. By the end of the 16th century, the term also included Russian squirrel skins shipped from the Baltic. The inventory lists the following items lined with squirrel, which would have been considerably cheaper than lynx or sable fur: </p><p></p><ul><li>Item a cote of black satten furred with calabre and edged with sables with iiii dosen viii buttons, black enameled with the garde sutelike to the cape (f.45r)<br/></li><li>Item a cote of shepes russett clothe with vi weltes of velvett, fringed on every side, furred with white calaber and edged with graye cony with vi dosen buttons black enameled (f.46r)<br/></li><li>Item a coate of black taffata welted with velvett, furred with white calaber and edged with greye wolfe (f.46r)<br/></li><li>Item a cassocke of russett sackclothe with iii weltes of russett velvett donne right, furred with calabre and edged with blacke wolfe, sett with iiii dosen vi buttons black enameled (f.46r)<br/></li><li>Item a cassocke of blacke clothe with vi laces about by ii and ii together with lowpe buttons of black silke, furred with calabre and edged with sables (f.46r)<br/></li><li>Item a cassocke of black velvett with vi laces aboute by ii and ii together with lowpe buttons of black silke, furred with calabre and edged with sables (f.46v)<br/></li><li>Item a cassocke of black satten with vi weltes of the same and betwene way two weltes a fringe of blacke silke and golde with lowpe buttons of black silke and golde, furred with calabre and edged with sables (f.46v)<br/></li><li>Item a cassock of russett velvett unshorne, trymmed about with a great parcement lace of russett silke and golde, furred with calabre, sett with iii dosen viii buttons blacke enameled (f.46v)<br/></li><li>Item an olde damaske cote imbrodered with pestoddes, furred with calabre (f.46v)<br/></li><li>Item a jerkin of white felt with sleves laied aboute with lace purled of crimsen silke and silver with xiii pointes of crimsen silke furred with white calabre (f.49v)<br/></li></ul><p></p><p><b>Rabbit</b></p><p>Rabbit (called cony) was a ubiquitous and inexpensive fur in the 16th century. Rarer varieties of rabbit could command a higher price and would not be considered out of place if worn at court. Black rabbit skins were considerably more expensive than grey ones, with black fur sprinkled with white hairs often costing around 6<i>s</i>. per skin. Black rabbit skins dominated the skinners’ trade for the high-end market and were also used to produce felt hats. Pembroke’s inventory lists a few garments lined with rabbit. </p><p></p><ul><li>Item a night gowne of blacke clothe with vi rounde pomell lace of blacke silke aboute the same and lowpe buttons of black silke, furred through oute with blacke conye (f.38r)<br/></li><li>Item a night gowne of russelt velvet with iii parcement lace of silke and golde aboute the same lowpe buttons of silke and golde, furred throughout with graye cony (f.38r)<br/></li><li>Item a gowne of blacke velvett with ii plaine gardes of the same, furred with blacke conye (f.41r)<br/></li></ul><p></p><p><b>Polecat</b></p><p>Polecat (referred to as <i>foyne</i>) or common ferret (<i>Mustela putorius</i>) was not an expensive fur. It was easily available from many parts of Europe. The inventory lists only one garment lined with polecat.</p><p></p><ul><li>Item a longe gowne of russett taffata with ii gardes of velvet laide on with iiii pomell lace of russett silke, purled on bothe the sides and lowpe buttons of russett silke, furred throughout with foyne (f.38v)<br/></li></ul><p></p><p><b>Genet</b></p><p>Skins of the genet cat (<i>Genetta genetta</i>) were imported from Spain and North Africa. They were the most valuable of all small cats’ skins, with domestic cats’ skins being regarded as of lesser quality than the skins of wild cats. With the genet, darker fur was considered more valuable. Naturally, Pembroke had black genet skin lining some of his garments. </p><p></p><ul><li>Item a gowne of blacke satten with vi rounde weltes of velvet, furred with blacke jennettes sett with iii dosen gold buttons, white blewe and blacke enamelled (f.40r)<br/></li><li>Item a gowne of blacke taffata with plaine gardes of blacke velvett, sett with ii dosen viii paire of greate aglettes enameled white, blewe and blacke with a pearle in the’einde of every aglett, furred throughout with blacke jennettes (f.40v)<br/></li></ul><p></p><p> <a href="genet-cat-skin/">Read more</a> on a genet cat skin embroidered panel in the V&amp;A.</p><p> </p><p><b>Fox</b></p><p>Fox could be a reference either to the red fox (<i>vulpes vulpes</i>) or the arctic fox (<i>vulpes lagopus</i>). The latter appears in the inventory in reference to a gown lined with the throats of white foxes. Red fox pelts were the most desired and came from northern regions where they would be thicker. They often displayed different colour patterns, such as grey or blackish variations. Fox-lined items within the inventory include: </p><p></p><ul><li>Item a gowne of blacke buckram with v weltes of velvet and on every side the welte a lace of blacke silke, furred with the throtes of white foxes with xxxvi buttons, white enamelled damaskin (f.40r)<br/></li><li>Item a gowne of russett silke sackclothe with one broade garde and twoe little gardes of blacke velvet. furred with foxe, with lowpe buttons of blacke silke (f.40r)<br/></li><li>Item a cassocke of black buckeram with v weltes of velvett and on every side the weltes a black lace of silke, furred with foxe with iiii dosen iii buttons, white enameled (f.46v)<br/></li></ul><p></p><p><b>Ermine</b></p><p>Although not referenced directly, Pembroke’s coronation and parliamentary robes (listed along with his Garter robes) would have been lined with ermine. This was the winter coat of the stoat (<i>Mustela erminea</i>), characterised by a thick white fur all over the animal’s body save for a black tip on the tail. </p><p></p><ul><li>Item the robes of the order, the robes of the coronation and for the parliament with theire whole furniture (f.38v)<br/></li></ul><p></p><p><b>Wolf</b></p><p>Grey wolf fur, including the melanistic black variety, was imported into England (often from Spain) to line male garments, such as: </p><p></p><ul><li>Firste a gowne of blacke satten all imbrodred over with blacke silke with ii plaine gardes of blacke velvet, furred with graye wolferinges, sett with iii dosen and x damaskin buttons (f.40r)<br/></li><li>Item a gown of black taffata with a garde and two weltes of velvett laide on with lace of black silke, furred with black wolferinges sett with xl golde buttons white and black enameled (f.41r)<br/></li><li>Item a gowne of black damaske with iii plaine gardes of velvelt, fringed on every side, furred with graye wolfe sett with xxxvi paire aglettes, white enameled (f.41r)<br/></li></ul><p></p><p><b>Lambskin</b></p><p>The last of the furs we find are on those garments lined with lambskin (termed generically as <i>budge</i>), which might also be edged with animal furs such as wolf or rabbit. The specific term <i>pampilion</i> used in the accounts refers to lambskin from Pamplona, capital of the province Navarre in northern Spain, which was of a particularly fine quality. </p><p></p><ul><li>Item a gowne of blacke satten with two plaine gardes of blacke velvet, furred with pampilion with iii dosen blacke silke buttons (f.40r)<br/></li><li>Item a gowne of black velvett imbrodered with hoopes furred with pampilion budge (f.42r)<br/></li><li>Item a coate of russett silke sackclothe [sic] with iii plaine gardes of black velvett, cutt and ravelled with black silke buttons, furred with white lambe and edged with graye wolferinges (f.46r)<br/></li><li>Item a jerkin of grene leather garded over with russett satten laied to on with russett silke and golde fringe and lace, lyned with redde pampilion with buttons of russett silke and golde and sleves to the same (f.49r)<br/></li><li>Item a jerkin of plaine black leather with sleves, furred with white lambe and leather buttons (f.49v)<br/></li><li>Item a jerkin with sleves of shepes colour with ii weltes of black velvett furred with white lambe and edged with greye cony (f.49v)<br/></li></ul><p></p><p>As an earl, Pembroke did not have to worry about sumptuary laws that restricted sables to the royalty, dukes, marquises, and earls; black genets and lynx fur to dukes, marquises, earls and their children, viscounts, barons, Knights of the Garter, and members of the Privy Council. Leopard skin was similarly restricted to these men, along with the sons of barons, knights, gentlemen attending her majesty, and ambassadors. Pembroke’s inventory is an invaluable source reflecting the widespread use of high-quality fur among the aristocracy in the Elizabethan period.</p><p><br/></p><p>KWM</p><p><br/></p><p>Further Reading:</p><p></p><ul><li>Natasha Awais-Dean, <i>Bejewelled: Men and Jewellery in Tudor and Jacobean England</i> (London, 2017)<br/></li><li>Elspeth M.

    <p>A detailed inventory was drawn up in 1561 for William Herbert, 1<sup>st</sup>
Earl of Pembroke (1506/7-1570) listing all his moveable goods, from the many
chairs in various properties to a ‘unicorns bone sett in golde with one turkois,
two rubies and iii diamonde’. The manuscript is held in the collections of the
National Art Library at the V&amp;A (MSL/1982/30).</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Within the inventory appears a list of his vast wardrobe, titled ‘An
inventory of all suche apparel, furres and jewelles as be in the charge of
Thomas Gregory, the xvii<sup>th </sup>of August anno domini 1561’ (f.38r). The
list is dominated by luxurious fabrics such as velvets, silks, satins, damasks,
and taffetas. They were decorated with lace, pearls, aglets, and gold or
enamelled buttons. Most of the outerwear is lined with expensive (and usually
imported) furs. In fact, it is often noted in the inventory when these garments
are not lined. So we read, ‘Item a night gowne of chaungeable taffeta, trimmed
with parcement lace of chaungeable silke and golde, without furre or lyninge’
(f. 38v). Sometimes, two types of fur may be used, as in the case of the
garment that is lined with squirrel fur and edged with sable fur. The following
list of references are ordered by the main lining used under the respective
animal fur.</p><p><br/></p>

<p><b>Sable</b></p>

<p>Sable is a species of marten (<i>Martes
zibellina</i>) that was famed for its soft dark-brown or black fur, a quality
that was noted by Edward Topsell in his <i>History
of four-footed beasts </i>(1607): The only price and estimation of this beast
is for the skin, which farre excelleth all the skins of the World […] if you
stroke them from the head to the tail, or on the contrary from the tail to the
head, they do lie every way smooth’. Sables were imported from Russia and were
the most expensive of furs.  According to
Jacob Ziegler (d. 1549), their price  had
'growne to great excess, next unto gold and precious stones'.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Pembroke’s sable garments included:</p>

<p></p><ul><li>Item a longe gowne of blacke satten with longe
sleves garded with blacke velvet, with ii weltes of velvet on bothe the sides
of the garde, laide between upon the garde, with blacke satten and lace of
blacke silke, with xliii buttons of golde and iii pearles on every button, furred
throughout with sables (f.38r)<br/></li><li>Item a longe gowne of blacke damaske with a
garde of velvet and a welte of velvet on either side of the garde, laide upon
with a pomell lace of silke purled on the’one side, sett with viii greate
buttons of golde with iii perles in every button, blacke, grene and blewe enamelled,
furred with sables (f.38r)<br/></li><li>Item a gowne of blacke satten with ii gardes of

    <p><b>Lynx</b><br/></p><p>Lynx was among the most expensive of furs to purchase in the sixteenth century. It was also one of the most distinctive, with its thick, spotted fur. The lynx has two coats: a short, reddish summer coat, and a thick grey-brownish winter coat. The latter was most valued for garments and, like sable, was imported from Russia. Pembroke owned two garments made with lynx fur, which was called <i>lucerne</i>. </p><p></p><ul><li>Item a gowne of blewe velvet with v weltes of the same and blewe silke and silver lace purled on every side with iiii dosen golde buttons enamelled white and blewe called pawnses, furred throughout with lusernes (f.40v)<br/></li><li>Item a gowne of russet satten with ii plaine gardes of velvet, fringed on every side and a lace of blacke silke upon the garde, sett with two dosen viii paire of greate aglettes full of pearles and furred throughe out with lusarnes (f.40v)<br/></li></ul><p></p><p><b>Squirrel</b><br/></p><p>Pembroke owned many garments lined with squirrel fur, which were often edged with other furs such as sable, wolf, or rabbit. The winter fur of red squirrels was most valued, in particular the soft, white belly fur and the dark, almost black, grey coat. The squirrel fur in this inventory is termed <i>calabre</i> (derived from the place name Calabria), however by this period it did not refer only to Italian squirrel skins but also to squirrel skins from Central Europe. By the end of the 16th century, the term also included Russian squirrel skins shipped from the Baltic. The inventory lists the following items lined with squirrel, which would have been considerably cheaper than lynx or sable fur: </p><p></p><ul><li>Item a cote of black satten furred with calabre and edged with sables with iiii dosen viii buttons, black enameled with the garde sutelike to the cape (f.45r)<br/></li><li>Item a cote of shepes russett clothe with vi weltes of velvett, fringed on every side, furred with white calaber and edged with graye cony with vi dosen buttons black enameled (f.46r)<br/></li><li>Item a coate of black taffata welted with velvett, furred with white calaber and edged with greye wolfe (f.46r)<br/></li><li>Item a cassocke of russett sackclothe with iii weltes of russett velvett donne right, furred with calabre and edged with blacke wolfe, sett with iiii dosen vi buttons black enameled (f.46r)<br/></li><li>Item a cassocke of blacke clothe with vi laces about by ii and ii together with lowpe buttons of black silke, furred with calabre and edged with sables (f.46r)<br/></li><li>Item a cassocke of black velvett with vi laces aboute by ii and ii together with lowpe buttons of black silke, furred with calabre and edged with sables (f.46v)<br/></li><li>Item a cassocke of black satten with vi weltes of the same and betwene way two weltes a fringe of blacke silke and golde with lowpe buttons of black silke and golde, furred with calabre and edged with sables (f.46v)<br/></li><li>Item a cassock of russett velvett unshorne, trymmed about with a great parcement lace of russett silke and golde, furred with calabre, sett with iii dosen viii buttons blacke enameled (f.46v)<br/></li><li>Item an olde damaske cote imbrodered with pestoddes, furred with calabre (f.46v)<br/></li><li>Item a jerkin of white felt with sleves laied aboute with lace purled of crimsen silke and silver with xiii pointes of crimsen silke furred with white calabre (f.49v)<br/></li></ul><p></p><p><b>Rabbit</b></p><p>Rabbit (called cony) was a ubiquitous and inexpensive fur in the 16th century. Rarer varieties of rabbit could command a higher price and would not be considered out of place if worn at court. Black rabbit skins were considerably more expensive than grey ones, with black fur sprinkled with white hairs often costing around 6<i>s</i>. per skin. Black rabbit skins dominated the skinners’ trade for the high-end market and were also used to produce felt hats. Pembroke’s inventory lists a few garments lined with rabbit. </p><p></p><ul><li>Item a night gowne of blacke clothe with vi rounde pomell lace of blacke silke aboute the same and lowpe buttons of black silke, furred through oute with blacke conye (f.38r)<br/></li><li>Item a night gowne of russelt velvet with iii parcement lace of silke and golde aboute the same lowpe buttons of silke and golde, furred throughout with graye cony (f.38r)<br/></li><li>Item a gowne of blacke velvett with ii plaine gardes of the same, furred with blacke conye (f.41r)<br/></li></ul><p></p><p><b>Polecat</b></p><p>Polecat (referred to as <i>foyne</i>) or common ferret (<i>Mustela putorius</i>) was not an expensive fur. It was easily available from many parts of Europe. The inventory lists only one garment lined with polecat.</p><p></p><ul><li>Item a longe gowne of russett taffata with ii gardes of velvet laide on with iiii pomell lace of russett silke, purled on bothe the sides and lowpe buttons of russett silke, furred throughout with foyne (f.38v)<br/></li></ul><p></p><p><b>Genet</b></p><p>Skins of the genet cat (<i>Genetta genetta</i>) were imported from Spain and North Africa. They were the most valuable of all small cats’ skins, with domestic cats’ skins being regarded as of lesser quality than the skins of wild cats. With the genet, darker fur was considered more valuable. Naturally, Pembroke had black genet skin lining some of his garments. </p><p></p><ul><li>Item a gowne of blacke satten with vi rounde weltes of velvet, furred with blacke jennettes sett with iii dosen gold buttons, white blewe and blacke enamelled (f.40r)<br/></li><li>Item a gowne of blacke taffata with plaine gardes of blacke velvett, sett with ii dosen viii paire of greate aglettes enameled white, blewe and blacke with a pearle in the’einde of every aglett, furred throughout with blacke jennettes (f.40v)<br/></li></ul><p></p><p> <a href="genet-cat-skin/">Read more</a> on a genet cat skin embroidered panel in the V&amp;A.</p><p> </p><p><b>Fox</b></p><p>Fox could be a reference either to the red fox (<i>vulpes vulpes</i>) or the arctic fox (<i>vulpes lagopus</i>). The latter appears in the inventory in reference to a gown lined with the throats of white foxes. Red fox pelts were the most desired and came from northern regions where they would be thicker. They often displayed different colour patterns, such as grey or blackish variations. Fox-lined items within the inventory include: </p><p></p><ul><li>Item a gowne of blacke buckram with v weltes of velvet and on every side the welte a lace of blacke silke, furred with the throtes of white foxes with xxxvi buttons, white enamelled damaskin (f.40r)<br/></li><li>Item a gowne of russett silke sackclothe with one broade garde and twoe little gardes of blacke velvet. furred with foxe, with lowpe buttons of blacke silke (f.40r)<br/></li><li>Item a cassocke of black buckeram with v weltes of velvett and on every side the weltes a black lace of silke, furred with foxe with iiii dosen iii buttons, white enameled (f.46v)<br/></li></ul><p></p><p><b>Ermine</b></p><p>Although not referenced directly, Pembroke’s coronation and parliamentary robes (listed along with his Garter robes) would have been lined with ermine. This was the winter coat of the stoat (<i>Mustela erminea</i>), characterised by a thick white fur all over the animal’s body save for a black tip on the tail. </p><p></p><ul><li>Item the robes of the order, the robes of the coronation and for the parliament with theire whole furniture (f.38v)<br/></li></ul><p></p><p><b>Wolf</b></p><p>Grey wolf fur, including the melanistic black variety, was imported into England (often from Spain) to line male garments, such as: </p><p></p><ul><li>Firste a gowne of blacke satten all imbrodred over with blacke silke with ii plaine gardes of blacke velvet, furred with graye wolferinges, sett with iii dosen and x damaskin buttons (f.40r)<br/></li><li>Item a gown of black taffata with a garde and two weltes of velvett laide on with lace of black silke, furred with black wolferinges sett with xl golde buttons white and black enameled (f.41r)<br/></li><li>Item a gowne of black damaske with iii plaine gardes of velvelt, fringed on every side, furred with graye wolfe sett with xxxvi paire aglettes, white enameled (f.41r)<br/></li></ul><p></p><p><b>Lambskin</b></p><p>The last of the furs we find are on those garments lined with lambskin (termed generically as <i>budge</i>), which might also be edged with animal furs such as wolf or rabbit. The specific term <i>pampilion</i> used in the accounts refers to lambskin from Pamplona, capital of the province Navarre in northern Spain, which was of a particularly fine quality. </p><p></p><ul><li>Item a gowne of blacke satten with two plaine gardes of blacke velvet, furred with pampilion with iii dosen blacke silke buttons (f.40r)<br/></li><li>Item a gowne of black velvett imbrodered with hoopes furred with pampilion budge (f.42r)<br/></li><li>Item a coate of russett silke sackclothe [sic] with iii plaine gardes of black velvett, cutt and ravelled with black silke buttons, furred with white lambe and edged with graye wolferinges (f.46r)<br/></li><li>Item a jerkin of grene leather garded over with russett satten laied to on with russett silke and golde fringe and lace, lyned with redde pampilion with buttons of russett silke and golde and sleves to the same (f.49r)<br/></li><li>Item a jerkin of plaine black leather with sleves, furred with white lambe and leather buttons (f.49v)<br/></li><li>Item a jerkin with sleves of shepes colour with ii weltes of black velvett furred with white lambe and edged with greye cony (f.49v)<br/></li></ul><p></p><p>As an earl, Pembroke did not have to worry about sumptuary laws that restricted sables to the royalty, dukes, marquises, and earls; black genets and lynx fur to dukes, marquises, earls and their children, viscounts, barons, Knights of the Garter, and members of the Privy Council. Leopard skin was similarly restricted to these men, along with the sons of barons, knights, gentlemen attending her majesty, and ambassadors. Pembroke’s inventory is an invaluable source reflecting the widespread use of high-quality fur among the aristocracy in the Elizabethan period.</p><p><br/></p><p>KWM</p><p><br/></p><p>Further Reading:</p><p></p><ul><li>Natasha Awais-Dean, <i>Bejewelled: Men and Jewellery in Tudor and Jacobean England</i> (London, 2017)<br/></li><li>Elspeth M.

                      <h3>More than one way to skin a cat</h3> <p>

<div class="page-content">
    
    
    <p>Cats, along with
being valued as mousers and prized as pets by doting owners, were also extensively
trapped, skinned, and sold and for their fur in medieval and early modern
Europe. Two species of cats were used: the domestic cat (<i>Felis catus</i>) and the European wild cat (<i>Felis silvestris</i>). Professional furriers devoted themselves to the
trade in wild cat skins, which were trapped by professionals. Wild cat fur was
thicker and more luxuriant than that of a domestic cat. In addition, the
markings and colour shade were fairly uniform, so that they could be sewn
together with ease. Domestic cat skin had the disadvantage of involving variegated
fur patterns and colours, so would produce an uneven effect if sewn together. A
less than honest furrier could attempt to correct this issue by dying the fur,
as evidenced by ‘cats painted’ being sold by members of the Skinner’s Company
in 1533. </p>

<p><br/></p><p>Cat fur was an
inexpensive fur, and in English sumptuary legislation usually appeared at the
bottom of the list (alongside lamb, rabbit, and fox) that could be worn by
anyone regardless of social status. Similarly, due to restrictions on muffs
made from furs such as sable in French sumptuary laws, cat (and dog) fur muffs
were worn by those of lower status.  </p>

<p><br/></p><p>There were still enough
populations of wild cats in Scotland to play a role in the late medieval
English fur trade, as evidenced in lists of tolls of fur exports between the
two countries. Nevertheless, there was a medieval trade of wild cat skins from
the continent to England, partly due to the colder winters in some parts of
Europe, which meant that the winter furs of the same species were finer than
their English equivalents. And of course, the lure of ‘foreign’ furs would have
also been a factor in the importation of cat fur. Peter the Venerable, the twelfth-century
abbot of Cluny, observed how some Frenchmen preferred Spanish or Italian cat
skins to local ones.</p>

<p><br/></p><p>However, by the
early modern period, wild cat skins were overwhelming imported into England. A
ship’s cargo of furs and skins docking in London in 1535 was valued at £50, and
along with fox, beech marten, hare, kid, lynx and genet skins, it included “12
linings of catt poughtes” (cat paws, presumably the skin with extant limbs). Duties
for imported cat skin into England in 1657 were assessed per barrel rather than
per cat skin, with each barrel containing one hundred cat skins. Wild cat skins
were among the huge amount of furs the Muscovy Company exported from Russia in
the seventeenth century. A shipment from Arkhangelsk in 1663 had a huge amount of cat skins among
its cargo of diverse furs, including beaver, seal, ermine, squirrel, and sable:
200,000  cat skins!</p>

    <p><br/></p><p>The trade in low-cost domestic cat skin was usually associated
with pedlars and thieves, as it
involved kidnapped pets and mousers.  Étienne
Boileau, provost of Paris, listed the tax on wild cats at two pence per half a
dozen skins. However, half a dozen "pelts of private cats, which are
called cats of the fireside or of the hearth" were taxed at one penny. A
thousand imported skins of "cats of the hearth" (<i>catorum ignium</i>) was taxed at only 4d when landing in Ipswich in
1303. </p>

<p><br/></p><p>A small-scale
trade in these skins was carried out by itinerant pedlars, who could trap
unsuspecting pets out for a ramble. In William Langland’s late fourteenth-century work <i>Piers Plowman</i>, the
personification of Avarice declares that “I have as moche pite of pore men as
pedlere hath of cattes, That wolde kille hem, iy he cacche hem myghte, for
coveitise of here skynnes.” This association continues in the early modern
period. In <i>The history of the blind beggar of Bednal-Green</i> (1686), the beggar keeps three to four
cat skins under heap of rags and shoes. When painting an image of a pedlar, Jheronimus
Bosch includes a tabby cat skin hanging from the side of his pack. </p>

<p><br/></p><p>Owing
to the difficulty of getting a consistent pattern when sewing the skins
together, cat skin was generally used for small objects, such as lining for
gloves, muffs or cat skin purses. The anonymous poem <i>Non-sense</i> (1617) declares that “Not that
a hard-roed herring should presume / To swing a tithe-pig in a cat-skin purse”.
References to cat-skin purses turn up in all kinds of sources, such as Thomas
Brown’s political dialogue <i>The Reasons of the News Converts</i><i> Taking Oaths to the Present Government </i>where Conscience
is characterised as a “Cat-skin pouch to put Mony in”. On a final slightly
bizarre note, John Dunton’s <i>The Dublin Scuffle</i> (1699) recounts how a man with a "natural antipathy against Cats" commissioned a muff from a furrier with the strict proviso that it not be made
with cat skin. The furrier nevertheless sells him a cat skin muff (presumably
as a way of cutting costs) without the client knowing. The gentleman takes the
muff away but on his way home, faints and does not recover until the feline
furred object is removed from his presence. A discussion on the innate
antipathy some people have against cats (and cheese) follows.</p><p><br/></p><p><b>KWM</b></p>

their English equivalents. And of course, the lure of ‘foreign’ furs would have
also been a factor in the importation of cat fur. Peter the Venerable, the twelfth-century
abbot of Cluny, observed how some Frenchmen preferred Spanish or Italian cat
skins to local ones.</p>

<p><br/></p><p>However, by the
early modern period, wild cat skins were overwhelming imported into England. A
ship’s cargo of furs and skins docking in London in 1535 was valued at £50, and
along with fox, beech marten, hare, kid, lynx and genet skins, it included “12
linings of catt poughtes” (cat paws, presumably the skin with extant limbs). Duties
for imported cat skin into England in 1657 were assessed per barrel rather than
per cat skin, with each barrel containing one hundred cat skins. Wild cat skins
were among the huge amount of furs the Muscovy Company exported from Russia in
the seventeenth century. A shipment from Arkhangelsk in 1663 had a huge amount of cat skins among
its cargo of diverse furs, including beaver, seal, ermine, squirrel, and sable:
200,000  cat skins!</p>

    <p><br/></p><p>The trade in low-cost domestic cat skin was usually associated
with pedlars and thieves, as it
involved kidnapped pets and mousers.  Étienne
Boileau, provost of Paris, listed the tax on wild cats at two pence per half a
dozen skins. However, half a dozen "pelts of private cats, which are
called cats of the fireside or of the hearth" were taxed at one penny. A
thousand imported skins of "cats of the hearth" (<i>catorum ignium</i>) was taxed at only 4d when landing in Ipswich in
1303. </p>

<p><br/></p><p>A small-scale
trade in these skins was carried out by itinerant pedlars, who could trap
unsuspecting pets out for a ramble. In William Langland’s late fourteenth-century work <i>Piers Plowman</i>, the
personification of Avarice declares that “I have as moche pite of pore men as
pedlere hath of cattes, That wolde kille hem, iy he cacche hem myghte, for
coveitise of here skynnes.” This association continues in the early modern
period. In <i>The history of the blind beggar of Bednal-Green</i> (1686), the beggar keeps three to four
cat skins under heap of rags and shoes. When painting an image of a pedlar, Jheronimus
Bosch includes a tabby cat skin hanging from the side of his pack. </p>

<p><br/></p><p>Owing
to the difficulty of getting a consistent pattern when sewing the skins
together, cat skin was generally used for small objects, such as lining for
gloves, muffs or cat skin purses. The anonymous poem <i>Non-sense</i> (1617) declares that “Not that
a hard-roed herring should presume / To swing a tithe-pig in a cat-skin purse”.
References to cat-skin purses turn up in all kinds of sources, such as Thomas
Brown’s political dialogue <i>The Reasons of the News Converts</i><i> Taking Oaths to the Present Government </i>where Conscience
is characterised as a “Cat-skin pouch to put Mony in”. On a final slightly
bizarre note, John Dunton’s <i>The Dublin Scuffle</i> (1699) recounts how a man with a "natural antipathy against Cats" commissioned a muff from a furrier with the strict proviso that it not be made
with cat skin. The furrier nevertheless sells him a cat skin muff (presumably
as a way of cutting costs) without the client knowing. The gentleman takes the
muff away but on his way home, faints and does not recover until the feline
furred object is removed from his presence. A discussion on the innate
antipathy some people have against cats (and cheese) follows.</p><p><br/></p><p><b>KWM</b></p>

<div class="page-content">
    
    
    <p>On 14
December 1663 the clergyman and writer John Beale appeared before the Royal
Society to discuss the making of parchment, and was subsequently invited to
submit a series of reports on the subject. These included illustrations of the
frame on which the clean skin was hung to dry, and detailed description of the
techniques involved in scudding and shaving the skin. Beale's submissions to
the Royal Society were part and parcel of the institution's fascination with
the natural knowledge involved in the production of crafts. For the Renaissance
Skin project they are revealing, not just for what they tell us about the skill
involved in making early modern parchment, but also for the knowledge of skin
on which the work relied, and the kind of skin product in which it resulted. </p><p><br/></p><p>Parchment is a material made from
the untanned skin of an animal, most often goat, sheep or cow. Although
parchment and the more refined vellum (parchment made from calf-skin) are
usually associated with the medieval period, parchment remained an important
material throughout the early modern era. Parchment remained the
writing-surface of choice for the growing range of experts in manuscript
culture, such as calligraphers, book binders, producers of heraldry, print-makers,
collectors and more. Moreover, while parchment is traditionally regarded as a
writing material, the range of objects that involved parchment were (and are)
considerably more varied than that. As Martin Engelbrecht's c.1730 print of a
female parchment-seller illustrates, drums, fans and frames were all items
commonly made from parchment. Early modern examples of such items still feature
in museum collections, as do organs, bows, items of furniture, wall-coverings
and purses. To name just one example <a href="https://pictures.royalsociety.org/image-rs-8462">Isaac Newton's telescope</a>, bound in vellum,
remains in the collection of the Royal Society, which also houses Beale's
report. Taking into account
the wider world of objects never collected in museums, (glue for example) one
can imagine an early modern society extensively familiar with the handling of
parchment. The function of parchment in such objects reflects the qualities of
skin itself: tensile, strong, unique from skin to skin. Audience members in
Beale's session had personal, sensory and tactile relations with parchment items,
and thus with the characteristics of skin that they communicated.<br/></p><p><br/></p>

    <p>But parchment did not just bequeath knowledge of skin. It relied on it. The history of parchment making is characterized by remarkable continuity in technique. A hundred years before Beale, Jost Ammann illustrated similar steps of the process in Germany, in his 1568 Book of Trades. Five centuries later, the last parchment factory in England still uses these techniques. The master craftsmen still working there were generous enough to provide our project with detailed insight into the process of making parchment, and the kind of relationship with skin it involves. For example, the first item with which Beale's report was concerned was the hanging frame on which the skin dried out. The parchment makers with which we spoke explained that this step requires a deep familiarity with the 'force lines' of skin, which has to be stretched very slowly, in such a way that the tension exerted by the drying out process will not make it so brittle that it snaps. Finding the lines of tension resides somewhere between visual and tactile knowledge of the skin. They differ from skin to skin. After locating the end points to these lines, the parchment-maker 'ties in' the skin and the process of shaving begins. Beale's second report shows the 'lunar' blade, as it is known today, a semicircular half moon of an object (Jost Ammann's parchment-maker is holding this in his hand). This is wielded to remove the lanolin, the oils on top of the skin. Beale describes this process as "a various motion in a rambling manner", but the implication that this might be haphazard or unintentional is misleading. Shaving the skin in this manner involves a huge degree of physical strength, and, like the tying-in of the skin, a near-intuitive feel for the placement and motion of the knife. At every stage of parchment making a feel for readiness plays an important role. Smell is crucial here, the parchment makers told us. Overall, making parchment requires sensory knowledge as well as manual dexterity.</p><p><br/></p><p>The finished product reflects its former life as skin in a way that even a lay bystander can appreciate. While the craft of the maker is evident in the fineness of the texture, which varies from the dark, aged appearance of parchment made from animals that have died of natural causes to the near translucent vellum, like a fingerprint, every skin is unique. Once crafted the parchment itself continues to bear the marks of the living skin. Veins, vessels, age, the health of the animal, marks of ill treatment, the vibrancy of a well-fed animal, even the marks of sun-tanning remain visible on the surface. Looking at parchment, the maker told us, can tell you about more than the written culture that produced it, it can tell you about animals, environment, diet, agriculture and changing patterns in the economy. As our guide reflected, "the skin has a memory.... you can read the whole life on its surface."<br/></p><p><br/></p><p>HM</p><p><br/></p><p>Title image: The Parchment Maker by Jost
