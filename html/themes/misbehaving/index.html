                      <h3>Canine Mange</h3> <p>

<div class="page-content">
    
    
    <p>The
treatment of canine skin afflictions was a core component of early modern texts
that dealt with hunting with hounds. Many of the pharmaceutical preparations were
empirically based, although dogs (as all animals) shared with man the same
humeral framework in their bodies. Thus, care was to be taken to keep their
bodies in balance. If out of sorts, overheated, or too cold, techniques such as
bloodletting, cupping, and purging were applied to the canine patient.</p><p><br/></p>

<p>George Gascoigne’s <i>The Noble
Art of Venerie or Hunting</i> (1576), a translation of Jacques du
Fouilloux’s <i>La Venerie</i> (1561), dealt with a number of subjects, including: mange, ringworm, scabies, animal bites
(from vipers, serpents, boars, bears, wolves, ‘or such like’), ear cankers,
plasters for sore feet, and preparations for sore ears, along with removing
fleas, lice, and other vermin. A careful and detailed surgical operation
involving incisions and tying up veins with thread was required to treat the
‘Wolfe, which is a kernel or round bunch of flesh, which groweth and increaseth,
until it kill the dogge’.</p><p><br/></p>

<p>There were four kinds of canine mange. Red mange was
considered to be the most dangerous. Caused by overheating, it would make a dog’s legs swell. The excess of heat could be due to variety of
causes, such as running in water while hot, lying in cold and wet places
without being ‘well dryed or rubbed’, or being a butcher’s dog, where the blood
of oxen and other beasts might cause this overheating. Scaly mange grew in patches (‘as broad as the palme of a mans hande’) and
removed the skin. Black mange ‘lyeth
under the skinne’ and caused the shedding of hair. Common mange was a result of either a dog lacking fresh drinking water or due to ‘foule and filthy lodging
and kennelling’, for example in a pig sty or simply lying on the straw on which a dog with mange
had slept. Unlike the other three types of mange a decoction of herbs could affect a cure.</p>

The dog had to first be purged then bathed and then the next day be bled of two ounces or more of blood. Within the next two days, the dog had to have a special ointment applied to its skin. In preparation for this, the dog would be washed and rubbed all over with a mixture of water and salt. The ointment was made of walnut oil, juniper oil, worm oil, honey, vinegar, rosin, pitch, new wax, sulphur, iron sulphate, and verdegris (copper carbonate). After anointing the dog with this ointment, which promised to ‘kill and heale all maner of manges and itches’, the patient would be tied up by a fire to promote a healthy sweat for an hour and a half (water would be provided to drink during this time). Once warm, the dog should be fed with a mutton broth that contained herbs and a bit of sulphur, eating this diet for eight days to complete the cure.<br/></p><p><br/></p><p>KWM</p><p><br/></p><p>Further Reading:</p><p></p><ul><li>George Gascoigne, <i>The Noble Art of

considered to be the most dangerous. Caused by overheating, it would make a dog’s legs swell. The excess of heat could be due to variety of
causes, such as running in water while hot, lying in cold and wet places
without being ‘well dryed or rubbed’, or being a butcher’s dog, where the blood
of oxen and other beasts might cause this overheating. Scaly mange grew in patches (‘as broad as the palme of a mans hande’) and
removed the skin. Black mange ‘lyeth
under the skinne’ and caused the shedding of hair. Common mange was a result of either a dog lacking fresh drinking water or due to ‘foule and filthy lodging
and kennelling’, for example in a pig sty or simply lying on the straw on which a dog with mange
had slept. Unlike the other three types of mange a decoction of herbs could affect a cure.</p>

                      <h3>Skin Disease</h3> <p>

<div class="page-content">
    
    
    <p>Some of the main sources of information about skin in early modern Europe are medical texts written on disease. The most famous of these, <i>On Skin Disease</i>
(1572) written by Girolamo Mercuriale, is often described today as 'the first dermatological treatise'. Yet skin was a focus in many
texts on disease, long before Mercuriale ever wrote his treatise. Rashes, ulcers,
lesions, boils, the temperature of skin, and its colour, were all common signs
a physician looked for and took into account when diagnosing disease (as indeed did
apothecaries, barber-surgeons, midwives, family members, or the patient).</p>

<p> </p>

<p>How these diseases were dealt with in the literature was not straightforward. The
dominant physiological paradigm for rashes was dictated by the Galenic humoral
system. In this model, as the historian
Michael Stolberg has described, a rash was understood to be the body ridding
itself of morbid or dangerous matter. Thus a rash was part of the process of
disease, rather than a disease in its own right. Moreover, a rash was seen as necessary and so not to be suppressed; in some cases it was even
promoted. Stolberg writes how 'Patients and, in the case of children, relatives felt relieved when a rash appeared'.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>From
the literature we can see that from the earliest days of print there were a
number of conditions that were understood to be skin diseases. Their symptoms on the skin were not only regarded with great fear, but also provoked
specific action across a number of different spheres. First and foremost was leprosy. By 1500, there were many hospitals and charities dedicated to providing care specifically for this disease. The most notorious of all diseases was undoubtedly the plague, identified by
historians and contemporaries alike by the colour and quality of lesions or
marks on the body. From the 1490s, the spread of syphilis (variously referred
to as 'pox', the 'French Disease', 'the Italian Disease' and other terms) saw
new attention paid to skin. At the same time, there was a mobilisation of printing and artistic techniques
used to illustrate and conceptualise skin disease. Albrecht Dürer's broadsheet (as illustrated here) was one of the earliest texts to
deal with syphilis. The illustrations show that even in its very
origin, efforts made to identify and treat pox were intertwined with efforts to
represent it. The iconography of French pox was rapidly established and
repeated elsewhere, as reflected by the author in this <a href="aztecs-smallpox/">piece on the Florentine Codex</a>. The epidemic nature and contagion associated with such
terrifying illnesses caused great fear and panic, but they also contributed to
changing conceptions of disease, treatment, and the role of skin in each.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Aside
from leprosy, plague, and pox, there were other skin conditions which frequently
appeared in medical texts. Within Book IV of Avicenna's canon, <i>Diseases Not Specific to Certain Organs</i>, are sections on smallpox (<i>De variolis</i>), measles (<i>De morbillo</i>), and a huge number of
inflammatory conditions most of which took place on the skin, including 'Persian Fire' or anthrax (<i>De pruna et igni persico</i>). Other ailments less well known by historians today were frequently
dealt with by sixteenth-century medical practitioners. So we find erysipelas (red
murrain or <i>Rotlauf</i>) detailed in sixteenth-century
medical compendia by Theodor Zwinger, as well as in later veterinary books. The
sixteenth century also saw the identification of 'new' diseases, such as scurvy by the physician Johann Weyer. Although today diseases such as this are not recognised as skin afflictions,
they were nevertheless identified by their chroniclers for the extreme effects they had upon the surface
of the body.</p>

<p> </p>

Future
posts will examine some of these individual ailments in greater depth. But for
now it is important to recognise that, despite the apparent hegemony of Galen and a general consensus on the physiology of skin (evident as we
have already seen in the commonly cited metaphor of the fisherman's net), in
the first half of the sixteenth century, there were multiple ways of
approaching skin and its disorders, within and outside of learned
medicine. Skin disease did exist. The potential for conceptual tension within
Galenism is one more example of the pliancy of early modern medical thinking
more generally, as a framework for explanation as well as a field of practice.<p><br/></p><p>HM</p><p><br/></p><p>Further Reading: <br/></p><ul><li>Michael Stolberg, <i>Experiencing Illness in Early Modern Europe </i>(Palgrave Macmillan, 2011).

    <p><a href="../defining/mercuriale-and-skin/">Girolamo Mercuriale</a> (1520-1606), the foremost physician
teaching in Italy in the second half of the sixteenth century, lectured on the
subject of pimples at the University of Padua in the 1580s. Notes on the lectures were
collected and organised, along with notes relating to other afflictions to facial beauty, by his
student Giulio Mancini (1559-1630), who would later gain fame as a physician
and art critic in Rome. The collection was first published as <i>De decoratione </i>in 1585, with
multiple editions appearing in the following decades. The chapter on pimples (<i>de
varis</i>) follows the humanist medical approach that Mercuriale applied to all of his
work. He begins by explaining the nomenclature of the Greek and Latin terms for
this affliction, followed by a long discussion on how pimples are created and develop, paying careful attention to
ancient medical authorities. According to Mercuriale, pimples were
most prevalent in young people (see image), due to their warm and damp complexions.</p><p><br/></p>

<p>As most skin afflictions were considered to have been caused by a humoral imbalance (in the case of pimples, an excess of thick and raw blood around the face), the physician was required to start from the 'inside out’ when
treating their patient. Firstly, the physician should identify the pustules as
pimples. They could be recognised by the little lump being slightly hard to the touch and the top being briefly red. If squeezed, they would expel <i>ichor
crassissimus</i> (a thick discharge). A regimen of health was then advised for the future: avoiding too much sun, exercise, salty or spicy food, or an excess of wine. Some blood would be let and then the body purged. The stomach and humours would be prepared before being purged and detailed recipes are supplied for each step of this process. Once purged, the physician should then examine the pimples and squeeze out the pus with either a needle or finger.
Once squeezed, the pimples could be softened with a variety of recipes. One suggestion was to wash the face with honey and vinegar. These softening recipes should be sufficient to remove
the pimples, but if they still remained and were hard ammoniac, frankincense, and Gaulish soup could be applied. This last remedy is the subject of a brief
discourse by Mercuriale, who mentions that one version - a soap made of ashes, salt, and oil - was still in use in Germany.</p><p><br/></p><p>Read translation of chapter 20 'On pimples':</p>

change in the fifteenth century, when humanists such as Lorenzo Valla made a
distinction between thermal baths and regular baths: thermal baths were those warmed up by nature; baths, or steam baths, were warmed by humans with the use of fire. Garzoni
noted that in the strictest sense, thermal baths in ancient Rome and in contemporary Germany were places where people went to sweat. In this respect, this made them proper medical spaces and Garzoni then refers the reader back to authorities
such as Arnau of Vilanova (c. 1238-1311) and Michele Savonarola (1385-1468). For Garzoni, sixteenth-century baths were different:

Their vices concern the impurity of the flesh, because very few steam bath attendants are not pimps who rent rooms, blending inner dirt with external dirt in those baths, which are the cradle of a thousand shameful and dishonest carnal desires.

<div class="page-content">
    
    
    <p>Giambattista della Porta’s <i>Magia naturalis</i> (Naples, 1558) was a hugely popular
printed book of secrets. This particular genre of writing details technical, medical, cosmetic, and
alchemical ‘experimental’ recipes that cover a huge variety of subjects, from
setting up your own distillation still to perfuming your gloves. Della Porta's text, <i>Natural
magick</i>, sought to understand the secret
properties of all natural beings: animal, vegetable, and mineral. In addition to multiple Latin editions, the work was also translated into French, Dutch, and English. The 1658 English version has been quoted here.</p><p><br/></p><p>The whole of Book IX is devoted to cosmetic recipes that deal with a broad range of subjects, including removing wrinkles, warts,
ringworm scabs, pimples, spots, sun-burn, or redness in the face; cleaning one's teeth; the dying of hair and eyebrows; and the preparation of lead paint, mercury water, and talc. The final chapter of the book (ch.XXX) is entitled ‘Adversus
mulieres ludicra’ ('Games against women'). It is in stark contrast to the book's title - 'On adorning women and making them beautiful' - for the goal of each of the five recipes is now one
of mockery: 'Thus far I have shewed how to beautifie women, now I shall attempt some things against their decking of themselves, and make some merriment after those things that I seriously discovered to adorn them'.</p><p><br/></p><p>The first experiment allows the practitioner to ‘spot’ if a woman has used face paint or not, claiming that a painted face will change colour due to the action of either saffron or brimstone: 'If you would know a painted Face, do thus: Chew Saffron between you Teeth, and stand neer to a woman with your mouth: when you talk with her, your breath will foul her Face, and make it yellowish; but if she be not painted, the natural colour will continue. Or burn Brimstone in the room where she is: for if there be Ceruss or Mercury sublimate on her Face, the smoak will make her brown, or black. The painted Women that walk at Puteoli, in the Mountains of Phlegra, are made so black, as Silver-money is, shut up in bags.' The next experiment has a similar aim - to discern if the lady has used a rouge: 'Chew Grains of Cummin, or a Clove of Garlick, and speak close by her; if it be natural, it will remain; but counterfeit with Ceruss or Quick-silver, it presently decays'.</p><p><br/></p><p>After these two diagnostic experiments, the following three cause a change in the skin itself (although two of them include instructions to rectify the damage caused by the prank). Two recipes affect the face, with the third concerning hair. Animals feature in each of these recipes: a stellio (lizard), a chameleon, and a salamander. The use of animals in cosmetic recipes was not out of the ordinary. Della Porta gives recipes for black hair dye that involve a tincture of wine-infused leeches, while another involved boiling a green lizard in oil which was then applied to the hair.<br/></p><p><br/></p><p>The first of these recipes causes a female face to be covered in red pimples. Averting red pimples was an aim of experiments covered earlier in the ninth book of <i>Magia naturalis</i> often involving eggs, with one recipe suggesting the application of an oil of burnt paper to the pimple. The ‘prank’ recipe caused the appearance of those ill-desired red pimples that were so detrimental to contemporary ideals of beauty of smooth, soft, and white skin. Directly referencing Pliny the Elder's <i>Natural History</i> for this, Della Porta writes 'Of a Stellio is made an ill Medicament: for when he is dead in Wine, all the Faces of those that drink of it, will be red-spotted Wherefore, they that would disfigure Whores, kill him in an Oyntment. The Remedy is, the yelk of an Egg, Honey and Glass. <i>Pliny</i>.'</p><p><br/></p><p>The next recipe relates to the changing of skin colour and it uses an animal famed for its ability to change the colour of its skin: the chameleon. The chameleon had been an animal of wonder for millennia, alleged to subsist on a diet of air like the mythical bird-of-paradise and able to turn into a variety of colours. In line with Aristotelian thinking, it was thought that the chameleon could not change its skin tone to white, in early modern cosmetics a colour which when accompanied by some redness on the cheeks was the ideal tone for the perfect sanguine complexion. The chameleon recipe was designed to make the face green and it cites Avicenna: '<i>Avicenna</i> saith, That the Decoction of Chamaeleon, put into a bath, will make him green-coloured that stays long in that bath; and then by degrees he will recover his former colour'.</p><p><br/></p><p>The final recipe within this chapter is to make hair fall off from either the head or the beard. Despite appearing in a section of tricks ‘against women’, this last experiment seems clearly aimed at men: 'Touch any part of mans body with a matter white as milk, that the Salamander vomits up out of its mouth, and the Hairs will fall off; and what is touched is changed into the Leprosie. <i>Pliny</i>.'</p><p><br/></p><p>However strange it might seem to end a long discussion on beautification with recipes against such a goal, prank recipes abound in Della Porta, so the ones detailed above must be considered within this tradition. Book XIV deals with culinary recipes but ends with a chapter on 'How to drive Parasites and Flatterers from great mens Tables’, which includes a recipe to turn a man's hands black when he wipes them with a napkin and one to make meat at a meal appear bloody and worm-ridden so that it is not eaten. Book XX is formed of a series of recipes listed in no particularly ordered way and includes some that are similar to the cosmetic pranks of Book IX. So, there are those to make a man’s face swell up, or to make a face appear extremely pale and lean, or even to allude to the likeness of 'Blackmores’. All of these recipes should be considered in the same vein as those that explain how to make women take off their clothes or coins turn around.</p><p><br/></p><p>KWM</p><p><br/></p><p>Further Reading:</p><p></p><ul><li>William Eamon, <i>Science and the Secrets of Nature: Books of Secrets in Medieval and Early Modern Culture </i>(Princeton, N.J., 1994)<br/></li><li>Giambattista della Porta, <i>Magia naturalis</i> (Naples, 1558) [available digitally at <a href="https://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a>.

    <p>In
early modern Europe, the essence of femininity was understood primarily in medical
terms in line with contemporary humoral theories that conceptualised the body as a

them moist and cold, whereas their male counterparts were taken to be naturally
hot and dry. Moreover, the bones and internal structure of a female body were considered

<p>Rest
and movement together constituted one of the six non-naturals (i.e. factors not
determined by the innate complexion) that acted upon an individual's disposition. In virtue of their clamminess and weakness, women were recommended in particular to exercise. In fact, activity was crucial to disperse the natural
excess of moisture which was thought to be at the root of female idleness and
dull-wittedness. Yet on the other hand, vigorous exertion brought women dangerously close to the 'hot' behaviours of a male complexion. Internal distempers also challenged
physiological boundaries, since sexuality in this period was considered fluid and could constantly shift according to humoral changes. The increase in heat generated
by corporeal exercise was thought to trigger such changes and – in extreme
cases – generate a radical mutation of sex.</p>

for the convalescent or the elderly. Commonly referred to as 'agitation', this

vigorous carriage ride, however, was endowed with a 'heating and thinning
property' that could help reduce weight. Moderate walking was also thought to

hot and dry. Moreover, the bones and internal structure of a female body were considered

                      <h3>Curing scabby sheep in sixteenth-century England</h3> <p>

<div class="page-content">
    
    
    <p><br/></p><p>Leonard Mascall (d. 1589) authored many books
(often translations and adaptions of other works) on subjects as diverse as
grafting, angling, medical recipes, removing stains from fabrics and catching
mice, rats and polecats. His first book on animal husbandry was devoted to
chickens (<i>The Husbandlye Ordring and
Gouernmente of Poultrie</i>, 1581). His second book on animal care had a wider scope and was titled <i>The first booke of
cattell wherein is shewed the gouernment of oxen, kine, calues, and how to vse
bulles and other cattell to the yoake, and fell</i>. It was published in
London, 1587. Addressed to the ‘husbandman’, so that it could ‘bee understood of
the unlearned husband man, as of the learned gentle man’, the book intended to
cover the ‘government’ (care) and presented remedies for cows, horses, sheep,
dogs, pigs, and goats (all domesticated animals covered under the generic term
‘cattle’). It was a volume of just over three hundred pages, in a
portable octavo size. Mascall collected material from various sources, both
contemporary and classical. The first book is dedicated to cows, the second to
horses, and the third to ‘the ordering of sheep and goatees, hogs and dogs.’
Regarding sheep, a wide variety of ailments were covered, from fevers, lice,
maggots, pestilence, and intestinal worms, along with advice for breeding
sheep, building a sheep pen, and buying the best breeds (sheep with long, soft,
white fleeces).</p>

<p><br/></p><p>Sheep were considered to be more prone to the ‘scabbe’ than any
other animal, caused by their exposure to cold weather and rain, with Mascall
quoting a translation of Virgil’s Georgics:<br/></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>When sheepe are greatly beaten with raine, </i></p>

<p><i>Then frost and cold encreaseth their paine: </i></p>

<p><i>Whereby the scabbe, will then encrease, </i></p>

<p><i>Which ye may kill, with tarre and fresh
grease. </i></p>

<p> </p>

<p>As a general prophylactic against the scab sheep should not be put on
grass covered with dew or frost, as this was considered a major source of the
‘scabbe’. Being thin also made sheep more prone to the scab, as did putting
them in a horse stable. Scratches from briers and thorns could also turn into
scabs.</p>

<p>Regarding the ‘itch’, an ointment made of goose grease, pitch, and
boiled young broom stalks should be rubbed onto the animal. Scabs and the
‘itch’ could be prevented by dipping the sheep in salted rain water right after
shearing.</p>

    <p><br/></p><p>Other remedies for ‘common scab’ involved mixing powdered sulphur,
cypress roots, camphor, wax and white lead (<i>blancht
rasis</i>) and rubbing the scab with the ointment three times. The affected area
would then be washed with wine lees (sediment at the bottom of the vessel) and
salt water, followed by a wash with plain water. Mascall commented that the
common shepherds tended to use a simpler ointment of tar and grease. In his
work however, he provided assorted recipes to cure the scab including: a wash
of boiled bear's-foot herb with milk thistle; a wash of elecampane roots; an
ointment of olive oil and sulphur; hemlock juice seasoned with salt and placed
in a dunghill a year; and, human urine (quenched on ‘hotte burning tilestones’
or boiled) mixed with henbane juice, cinnamon, salt and the powder of tiles.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Darters was a term for scabs on a sheep’s chin, mouth, and lips. Like
the ‘common scab’, it was said to be caused by shepherds negligently allowing
sheep to graze on dew-covered grass. The recommended treatment involved rubbing
the area with a mixture of vinegar and hyssop, followed by washing it with
vinegar, and finally applying an ointment of pig-grease and tar. Other
recommended remedies included a mixture of verdigris and old grease, or an
infusion of cypress leaves. Mascall emphasised the need to act rapidly with all
forms of scab, as it was highly contagious and ‘if they be not holpen in time,
one sheepe wil infect all the rest in short space’. Similarly, lambs could catch
‘scabbiness’ from adult sheep, which could be cured with a mixture of tar and
grease or cow-foot oil (although goose grease was considered the best). Another
type of scabbiness that affected sheep’s mouths was blamed on them eating the
tops and flowers of furze or gorse. This was best treated with rubbing the area
with fresh butter, but an ointment of boiled plantain juice and grease could
also be used.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Side effects of the scab were bald patches on a sheep’s fleece. To make
the wool grow again, Mascall suggested various shepherd’s recipes for ointments,
such as a mixture of butter, oil, goose grease (or just ‘fresh grease’). Another
involved mixing tar and oil with burnt daffodil bulbs, water-lily root or
burdock. Cress mixed with mustard could be used too, as could crow’s foot (the plant) with
oil, all with the same aim of encouraging wool growth again.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>‘Scabby’ sheep could be spotted by bits of their fleece hanging loose
on their backs, and it was incumbent on any shepherd to check his flock daily
for the scab or the ‘pocks’, which were recognisable on the skin by a profusion
of red or purple pimples, the size of ‘farthings’ (a very small coin fragment).
The sheep’s behaviour also provided clues, as an animal scratching, biting or
rubbing their bodies, either with their mouths, feet, horns or rubbing
themselves against a tree, causing the scratched skin to redden, were likely to
have either the scab or lice.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The moment a sheep was spotted with scabs, it should be removed from
the flock and placed in fresh pasture.  The aim was to make sure that the sheep was
‘sodeinly remedied, to the end that al the rest be not infected with the same.’
The rest of the flock should be monitored. If any displayed signs of scabbiness
a wash with water might be helpful (although to be avoided in a frost). Mascall
suggested more ointments including nightshade juice mixed with grease, garlic
mixed with tar, a wash of artichoke juice or Spanish chamomile (‘pelitory of
spain’) and vinegar.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Finally, as a treatment for dried scabs (‘tetters’) as opposed to the
open sores of the common scab, Mascall recommended either sorrel roots, hazel
wort or the gum of cherry trees soaked in vinegar to rub on the dried scab. The
area could also be anointed with a mixture of soap and Armenian bole (a red
clay from Armenia, containing iron oxide).</p>

                      <h3>Badgers, lions and sharks! Animal metaphors for diseased skin</h3> <p>

<div class="page-content">
    
    
    <p>Extending
the conversation in <a href="../defining/skin-and-material-metaphors-sixteenth-century-texts/">‘Skin and Material Metaphors in Sixteenth Century Texts’</a>, this
post examines animal metaphors for skin. The skin of quadrupeds and humans
was usually understood to have the same formation, layers (<i>cutis</i> and <i>cuticula</i>), and
function (as a means of eliminating bodily wastes).  However, regarding metaphors, animal skin is usually
connected with diseased skin, to exemplify rough, broken, or swollen human skin.
The names of many diseases point to how a disease was understood to manifest
itself on the skin of the afflicted. The swollen lymph nodes of the neck of a
scrofulous patient were thought to resemble the mammary glands of a pregnant
pig (<i>scrofa/scrofula</i>). </p><p><br/></p><p><i>Cancer</i>
(Latin, crab) was applied to the disease by Roman Celsus (1<sup>st</sup>
century AD), translating directly the Hippocratic term <i>karkinos</i> for a malignant tumour. By the late medieval period the
analogy not only depended on the tumour’s resemblance to the animal, but also
its behaviour as a hungry beast eating the surrounding flesh. Thus in 1597 the
surgeon Peter Lowe wrote that apart from looking like crabs, cancers ‘gnaweth,
eateth and goeth like this fish’ and the physician Philip Barrough (1584) emphasised
the crab’s resolute nature as cancer ‘verie hardly pulled awaie from those
members, which it doth lay holde on, as the sea crabbe doth, who obstinately
doth cleave to that place which it once hath apprehended’. </p><p><br/></p><p>This
ravenous animal might have to be literally fed to assuage its hunger. The
surgeon Guy de Chauliac (d. 1368, still very influential in the early modern
period) commentated how some people would ‘feed’ the tumour with hen’s flesh to
avoid it eating the person. The surgeon Daniel Turner (1667-1741), author of <i>De Morbis Cutaneis</i> (1714), when
discussing worms in cancers (a long-standing early modern medical belief)
asserted that ‘perhaps the Progress of the Corrosion is sometimes stopt, by
applying the Flesh of a Chick, to which these Animals stick, leaving the coarse
for the finer Food’. The practice of ‘feeding’ a cancer was still attested in
the 19<sup>th</sup> century by the French surgeon Anthelme Richerand (d. 1840)
who described how a female patient with breast cancer who applied a large piece
of veal to her breast to “appease (she said) the hunger of the monster which
was devouring her”. </p><p><br/></p><p>The
first references to a disease called ‘The Wolf’ (<i>lupus</i>) appear in the tenth century and for the twelfth century Salernitan
surgeon Rogerius Frugardi, who wrote a <i>Practice
of Surgery</i>, the term <i>lupus</i> was
used to describe corrosive facial lesions and lesions on the lower limbs. On
the face it was <i>noli me tangere</i>
(touch me not), and on the thighs, it was a type of cancer (his student, Roland
of Parma called these thigh lesions <i>lupula,
</i>little she-wolf). Overtime the term was gradually replaced in many medical
texts with <i>herpes estiomenus</i>, a snake
analogy replacing the wolf. This name had been used in Classical texts for a corrosive
skin disease, <i>herpes</i> from the Greek
term to “slither like a serpent,” as the disease appeared to creep across skin,
and <i>estiomenus</i>, for “eating”. However,
the ‘wolf’ was still used in the early modern period to designate some cancers
and also appears in veterinary medicine. <i>The
Noble Arte of Venerie or Hunting</i> (London, 1575), George Gascoigne’s translation
of Jacques du Fouilloux <i>La vénerie </i>(Poitiers,
1561) discusses it in detail in two entries, the first of which is titled: ‘A
Receipt to heale the disease called the Wolfe, which is a kernell or round
bunch of flesh, which groweth and increaseth, vntill it kill the dogge’. </p><p><br/></p><p>Drawing on ancient,
Arabic, and medieval (primarily from Salerno and Montpellier) sources, the
early modern medical classification of leprosy was completely based on the
resemblance of the leprous patient’s skin to a particular animal’s skin and
behaviour. <i>Elephantia</i> was caused by an excess of black bile and the
accompanying signs were thick, rough skin of a blackish colour, covered in
tuberosities and nodes. Like an elephant the
disease was strong both regarding cause and cure, with a slow increase (and a slow
cure). The second form, <i>leonina</i>, was blamed
on an excess of yellow bile, with symptoms resembling a lion: loss of eyebrows,
wrinkles a bulging forehead, accompanied by yellow skin and urine (for Avicenna
it made the patient look terrifying and was the form of leprosy most common in
lions themselves). Regarding behaviour, the disease was considered to be both
ferocious and swift.   The third form was <i>tyria </i>which<i> </i>had the
characteristics of a snake. It was named for the highly venomous tyrus snake,
which lived in the region around Jericho. A patient suffering with<i> tyria</i> (caused by an excess of phlegm)
would have a very pale face, with white scaliness and urine. Descriptions of
this form often emphasised the snake-like shedding of skin, with the patient
often rubbing or scratching themselves to shed their skin. The final form was
considered the mildest: <i>alopecia</i>,
caused by an excess of blood, and ascribed to the fox, with patients affected by
hair loss and a red face and eyes.<br/></p><p><br/></p><p>These
animals were not the only ones used as analogies for leprosy. The Basel
physician Johann Jakob Huggelin (d. 1564), following Galen, discussed how a
leprous patient’s face resembled that of a satyr, and that they would imitate
the creature’s lecherous behaviour. The Portuguese physician Velasco de
Tharanta (fl. 1418) claimed Galen was not referring to satyrs with the use of
the word ‘saton’, but instead to the badger (‘taxus’).</p><p><br/></p><p>Animal
metaphors were not restricted to classical or medieval archetypes. The
Jesuit José
de Anchieta (1534 – June 1597) described an epidemic of smallpox (<i>viruelas</i>) affecting the indigenous
population in São Vicente in Southern Brazil. Observing the sores on the patients’
bodies, Achieta divided them into benign (<i>dulces</i>),
known (<i>acostumbrados</i>) and ‘horrible’
new ones which covered the entire body. The latter sores caused the sufferer’s
skin to resemble the skin of the dogfish (<i>cuero
de cazón</i>), sharks of the <i>Squalidae</i>
family.<br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Apart from these metaphors for
diseased skin, other animals abounded in medical texts in connection with skin,
such <i>formica</i> (the sensation of ants
crawling under one’s skin) or the use of verbs of biting or devouring. For example, the Latin verb <i>corrodere</i> (to gnaw to pieces) was used to describe the effect of
tissues being eaten away; the destruction of humours, ulcers, and wounds; or
the corrosive or destructive effects of medicines, poisons or caustics. All
these metaphors point to the multiple ways medical authors attempted to explain
the complex nature of skin through beasts familiar to their audience. <br/></p><p><br/></p><p>KWM<br/></p><p><br/></p><p><b>Further

                      <h3>Curing your pet dog’s mange in the 17th century</h3> <p>

<div class="page-content">
    
    
    <p>The medical care of pets is a lacuna in medieval and early modern
sources. Specialist texts on animal care focused overwhelmingly on horses, with a
small portion devoted to livestock (sheep, cattle, pigs and the like) and
hunting hounds.  We know that companion
animals were widely kept in the period, evidenced, from letters, account-books,
iconography, poetry, among the wide array of available sources. Nevertheless,
their health care remains a mystery as we do not even have one source devoted
to the subject, even though there were volumes available at the time devoted
solely to chickens (<i>The Husbandlye
Ordring and Gouernmente of Poultrie</i>
in 1581).</p><p><br/></p><p>Horses dominate the field, with many available farrier’s
manuals and learned equine treatises, and unsurprising in a world where many of
these would be high status and expensive animals, worthy of paying someone when
they fell ill or having someone to hand at the stables who could provide
medical care.  Small animal practice was
frowned upon as rather unworthy for a trained professional, and this would
continue to the case until the twentieth century (see Alison Skipper’s recent
article on Edwardian elite veterinarians catering to the ‘dog fancy’).</p><p></p>

<p><br/></p><p>Sources regarding
the care of dogs do appear in hunting manuals, which often include sections on how
a kennel master should care for the hound pack. For example, George Gascoigne’s <i>The Noble Art of
Venerie or Hunting</i> (1576) [<a href="/themes/misbehaving/#image_thumb60">bit.ly/2LoHHUo</a>]
discusses in one chapter (79):</p><p><br/></p><p></p>

<p>'Receipts, to heale sundrie diseases and infirmities in houndes and
dogges' after the bulk of the text, which deals with how to train your hounds
for a variety of prey, such as deer, hares, foxes and badgers. Unlike learned
equine treatises, there is almost no theory in this manuals, only simple
preparations to cure common ailments such as rabies, fleas, mange, and sore
paws. We do not know if this material was appropriated for the care of small
household pets.'</p>

<p><br/></p><p>Household recipe
collections present a similar problem. While they are replete with medicines
for the reader to prepare and administer to sick household members, we do not
know if this extended to household pets. Would a recipe for a human with an
upset stomach be given to a pet suffering from the same complaint? There are
occasionally prescriptions for animals in these collections, such as one for a
‘Horse sick of the Plague in the guts’. However, even when there is a rare reference
to a dog, how can we tell that these was for household pet? (the vast majority
of recipes regarding dogs are for preparations against dog bites, rather than
curing them!).</p><p><br/></p>

<p>A rare glimpse of specialist care for pet dogs can be found in the seventeenth-century
recipe-book of <a href="https://wellcomelibrary.org/item/b19145032#?m=0&amp;cv=101&amp;c=0&amp;s=0&amp;z=0.0052%2C-0.1487%2C0.926%2C0.9279">Johanna St John in the Wellcome Library, Ms 4338</a>.
Johanna St John collected and tested both medical and culinary recipes, as
evidenced in her large correspondence (see Elaine Leong’s <i>Recipes and
Everyday Knowledge)</i>. The two recipes of interest specially refer to a
‘little dog’. Diminutive size was one of the characters of pet dogs kept by
ladies, which could be carried or placed on laps, cushions, or beds. Given the
female authorship, I believe that both of these recipes are specifically meant
for small pet dogs that would have been kept in the house, rather than the
larger hunting specimens outside in the kennels. Both are recipes to cure
mange, which in the seventeenth century was understood to be caused by intemperate
choleric or sanguineous humours inside the body that would manifest themselves
on the surface of the skin. This was the prime cause of mange (and scabies,
considered to be the same disease in humans), although the contagious nature of
the disease was also recognised. </p>

<p><br/></p><p>The first recipe is on f. 1r of Ms 4338 and is not in Johanna’s own
hand. It states: </p><p><br/></p>

<p>'For the Itch in man or
woman or mange in a Dog: Half a pound of flower of Brimston or sulphur &amp; a quart
of white wine put together give a wine glasse to a man or woman a very night to
a little dog 2 spoonfule a nott lys expenen’. The same ingredients (wine and
sulphur) are used for both humans and the ‘little dog’. This is not
unsurprising as the disease (called here ‘itch’ for the human sufferers) was considered
to be the same. The only difference is in the quantity of the medicine and the
mode of administering it. The humans get the mixture in a wine glass while
spoonfuls are given to the pet dog.'</p>

<p><br/></p><p>The second recipe is in Johanna’s own hand and appears on f. 271v of
the manuscript:</p><p><br/></p>

<p>'For a mang in a
Dog:<b> </b>As much as a nut meg of uenes Turpentine &amp; as much as a gray

                              <h3>Curing your pet dog’s mange in the 17th century</h3> 

<div class="page-content">
    
    
    <p>The medical care of pets is a lacuna in medieval and early modern
sources. Specialist texts on animal care focused overwhelmingly on horses, with a
small portion devoted to livestock (sheep, cattle, pigs and the like) and
hunting hounds.  We know that companion
animals were widely kept in the period, evidenced, from letters, account-books,
iconography, poetry, among the wide array of available sources. Nevertheless,
their health care remains a mystery as we do not even have one source devoted
to the subject, even though there were volumes available at the time devoted
solely to chickens (<i>The Husbandlye
Ordring and Gouernmente of Poultrie</i>
in 1581).</p><p><br/></p><p>Horses dominate the field, with many available farrier’s
manuals and learned equine treatises, and unsurprising in a world where many of
these would be high status and expensive animals, worthy of paying someone when
they fell ill or having someone to hand at the stables who could provide
medical care.  Small animal practice was
frowned upon as rather unworthy for a trained professional, and this would
continue to the case until the twentieth century (see Alison Skipper’s recent
article on Edwardian elite veterinarians catering to the ‘dog fancy’).</p><p></p>

<p><br/></p><p>Sources regarding
the care of dogs do appear in hunting manuals, which often include sections on how
a kennel master should care for the hound pack. For example, George Gascoigne’s <i>The Noble Art of
Venerie or Hunting</i> (1576) [<a href="/themes/misbehaving/#image_thumb60">bit.ly/2LoHHUo</a>]
discusses in one chapter (79):</p><p><br/></p><p></p>

<p>'Receipts, to heale sundrie diseases and infirmities in houndes and
dogges' after the bulk of the text, which deals with how to train your hounds
for a variety of prey, such as deer, hares, foxes and badgers. Unlike learned
equine treatises, there is almost no theory in this manuals, only simple
preparations to cure common ailments such as rabies, fleas, mange, and sore
paws. We do not know if this material was appropriated for the care of small
household pets.'</p>

<p><br/></p><p>Household recipe
collections present a similar problem. While they are replete with medicines
for the reader to prepare and administer to sick household members, we do not
know if this extended to household pets. Would a recipe for a human with an
upset stomach be given to a pet suffering from the same complaint? There are
occasionally prescriptions for animals in these collections, such as one for a
‘Horse sick of the Plague in the guts’. However, even when there is a rare reference
to a dog, how can we tell that these was for household pet? (the vast majority
of recipes regarding dogs are for preparations against dog bites, rather than
curing them!).</p><p><br/></p>

<p>A rare glimpse of specialist care for pet dogs can be found in the seventeenth-century
recipe-book of <a href="https://wellcomelibrary.org/item/b19145032#?m=0&amp;cv=101&amp;c=0&amp;s=0&amp;z=0.0052%2C-0.1487%2C0.926%2C0.9279">Johanna St John in the Wellcome Library, Ms 4338</a>.
Johanna St John collected and tested both medical and culinary recipes, as
evidenced in her large correspondence (see Elaine Leong’s <i>Recipes and
Everyday Knowledge)</i>. The two recipes of interest specially refer to a
‘little dog’. Diminutive size was one of the characters of pet dogs kept by
ladies, which could be carried or placed on laps, cushions, or beds. Given the
female authorship, I believe that both of these recipes are specifically meant
for small pet dogs that would have been kept in the house, rather than the
larger hunting specimens outside in the kennels. Both are recipes to cure
mange, which in the seventeenth century was understood to be caused by intemperate
choleric or sanguineous humours inside the body that would manifest themselves
on the surface of the skin. This was the prime cause of mange (and scabies,
considered to be the same disease in humans), although the contagious nature of
the disease was also recognised. </p>

<p><br/></p><p>The first recipe is on f. 1r of Ms 4338 and is not in Johanna’s own
hand. It states: </p><p><br/></p>

<p>'For the Itch in man or
woman or mange in a Dog: Half a pound of flower of Brimston or sulphur &amp; a quart
of white wine put together give a wine glasse to a man or woman a very night to
a little dog 2 spoonfule a nott lys expenen’. The same ingredients (wine and
sulphur) are used for both humans and the ‘little dog’. This is not
unsurprising as the disease (called here ‘itch’ for the human sufferers) was considered
to be the same. The only difference is in the quantity of the medicine and the
mode of administering it. The humans get the mixture in a wine glass while
spoonfuls are given to the pet dog.'</p>

<p><br/></p><p>The second recipe is in Johanna’s own hand and appears on f. 271v of
the manuscript:</p><p><br/></p>

<p>'For a mang in a
Dog:<b> </b>As much as a nut meg of uenes Turpentine &amp; as much as a gray
peas of quicksilver beat them together tel you cannot se the quicksilver then
role it up in Butter and give it fasting &amp; let the dog fast 4 howers or
more you need giv it but ones this is for a little dogg tried it to two of
mine.'</p>

<p><br/></p><p>This second recipe is an excellent example of household testing
strategies that appear in so many of these recipes, where evidence is attested
of trials (and any modifications) of recipes on family members and servants to
test efficacy. Here Johanna states that she has tested it on two of her pet
dogs. Both recipes, apart from the rarity of involving pet dogs, are unusual in
the fact that the preparation is to be ingested, either as a liquid or in pill

preparation as the main cure. These would be ointments, which in the early
modern period were most frequently made from sulphur and/or mercury (often with

                      <h3>Fortunio Liceti: The Skin of Monsters</h3> <p>

<div class="page-content">
    
    
    <p>While early modern European
physicians and naturalists were notoriously fascinated by monsters, such
creatures elicited curiosity and wonder only when they were confined to their
own specific spaces in books, paintings, museum collections, or freakshows.
Everyday monstrously disfigured faces would certainly cause horror. Horror and repugnance formed a mixed reaction in the
beholder who happened to come across disfigured people. The disfigured person
was similar to a monster, but not quite like it, since its status was the
product of injury or illness, and not of congenital defects or its belonging to
strange, exotic “races.” </p><p><br/></p>

<p>Fortunio Liceti (1577-1657) – polymath, antiquarian,
physician, natural historian and natural philosopher – was one of the key
figures of early modern teratology. Liceti had studied arts and medicine in Bologna,
and then moved to Padua, where he became professor of theoretical medicine. His
book on monsters was first published, without illustrations, in 1616; a second,
beautifully illustrated edition came out in Venice in 1634. Liceti is often
credited as being one of the first thinkers who naturalized monsters, and
indeed he made a systematic effort to classify monsters by following a
naturalistic definition. According to Liceti, a monster was: “a being under
heaven which provokes in the observer <strong>horror and astonishment</strong>
by the incorrect form of its members, and is produced rarely, begotten, by
virtue of a secondary plan of nature, as a result of some hitch in the causes
of its origin … [monsters are] faults of nature
when she does not proceed in the right way.” And he added: “It is in
this [monstrous births] that I see the convergence of both nature and art,
because one or the other not being able to make what they want, at least they
make what they can.” </p><p><br/></p>

<p>Liceti’s
book made reference to grafting and monstrosities in plants and humans. He made
use of Gaspare Tagliacozzi’s surgical procedure  as a tool to clarify the status of monsters caused by “an excess of matter.”
While discussing the tenth cause of <i>monstri
excedenti</i>, which is some kind of “violent consussion of the body of the
mother,” Liceti described the case of a pair of twins, “already formed,” who
suffered from a blow to the pregnant woman’s body. The skin of the twins could
be excoriated and coalesce through the union of blood – acting as glue – in
unnatural shapes. “While we were students in Bologna, we have seen several
times our master Tagliacozzi re-making human noses by excoriating the scars on
the nose, and then attaching the skin of the arm to the face in the space of a
few days. This can be seen even in trees when, once the bark has been removed
from different parts and tied together, they are glued together thorugh the
action of the nourishing juices which flows through both parts.” Liceti used his former teacher’s surgical procedure as an
analogy to explain the status of human monsters as preternatural entities.
Monsters emerged through a blind assemblage of natural causes giving way to
unprecedented and singular outcomes. </p><p><br/></p>

<p>There is more. In his discussion of “monsters with a double nature”
Liceti mentioned the disturbing example of man-made monsters. These were either
made unintentionally by poorly skilled empirics and barber-surgeons, or
intentionally by the art of people seeking to make money with freak shows. The seventh cause of such <i>monstri ancipiti</i> consisted in “an imitation of nature’s faults by
art, not without the help of nature.” Liceti could not fail to notice that “art
can produce monsters.” Indeed, all the works of nature were carried on either
by nature alone or with some kind of cooperation. There were cases “when art,
if it is able to fashion some kind of monster, cannot help the workings of
nature to this end: in fact, the origin of a monster properly depends upon
nature. Indeed, the active action of the art can only apply itself to the
natural things which are passive: so monsters made with the cooperation of art
are to be considered as natural products. Awe can observe another benefice of
the art, or in some respect a misdeed, in plants: here, living monsters can be
produced; even if farmers disagree on that, they can produce one single species
starting from differentt trees through grafting and ligations, and in this way
they obtain living beings which have a monstrous nature.” </p><p><br/></p>

<p>Liceti used
Tagliacozzi’s principle of grafting to illustrate the monstrous potential of
the combination of human shapes, also alluding to artificially created monsters
made through the human art of grafting. For example, Liceti reported a 1466
case of two boys in France who were struck by lightning and found attached
together in one single body through their burning parts. Patients with burnings
who were not treated properly could assume monstrous shapes too. Skin was both the material and the means through which
unusual body shapes could come into being.</p><p><br/></p><p>PS</p><p><br/></p><p>Image: Fortunio Liceti, <i>De caussis</i> (1634): monstrous twins.</p><p></p><p><br/></p><p>Further readings:<br/></p>

parasitic mites. The itchy rash is caused by the female of the species (<i>sarcoptes
scabiei</i>) burrowing under the first layer of the epidermis to lay her eggs.  For early modern medicine, the initial
outbreak of the condition was due however not to mites, but an humoreal
imbalance. An abundance of blood was usually alleged to be the prime causative
factor, although other humours (black bile salty phlegm, choler) could also
cause the condition. Although Galen himself in the second century AD listed
scabies as a prime example of contagious disease (along with ophthalmia and
phthisis), understanding the individual’s humoreal complexion was still
essential when diagnosing and treating early modern scabies. Its highly
contagious nature is more commonly discussed in agrarian and equine treatises and
is rather rare in medical works dealing with human patients. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Traditional histories of medicine often point to Giovanni Cosimo Bonomo’s
late seventeenth-century ‘discovery’ of the scabies mite as a watershed in
understanding the causes of this affliction. Bonomo examined samples of skin
from several itchy people and spotted under his microscope the scabies mite. He
recounted these observations, complete with a drawing of the culprit, in a
letter to Francesco Redi (printed as <i>Osservazioni intorno a' pellicelli del
corpo umano</i>, Peitro Matini: Florence, 1697). However, the scabies mite was
not broadly accepted by the medical community as the cause of scabies until the
mid-nineteenth century.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>However, this is not to say that mites were ignored, merely that their
presence on the skin was not connected to scabies. The mite, not distinguished
by species, was called <i>acarus</i> in Latin, <i>ciron</i> in French, <i>seur </i>in
German, <i>hand-worm </i>in English, and in Italian a <i>pedicello</i>, among
other terms. A reference to their small size appears in William Shakespeare’s
Romeo and Juliet (Act 1 Scene 4) when Mercurio describes Queen Mab’s petite
wagoner as “a small gray-coated gnat, Not half so big as a round little worm
Pricked from the lazy finger of a maid.” </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Mites, like fleas and lice, were believed to spontaneously generate on
the surface or just under the first layer (cutis) of the skin. Like all such
vermin, they were caused by a noxious mix of humours that caused putrid
excrements to be pushed up through the pores to the skin’s surface, on which
they would be created. There could confusion between all of these small
annoying creatures. The twelfth-century <i>Trotula </i>(texts on women’s
medicine) has recipes to remove worms or mites (titled <i>vermes</i>, <i>formicaciones
</i>and<i> syrones</i>) that affect the hands and feet and those that appear on
the body, especially the face. The same term for mites (<i>syrones</i>) was
also used for little animals that eat the hair, which is more likely a
reference to lice. In his 1363 <i>Chirurgia magna</i> the fourteenth-century
French surgeon Guy de Chauliac spoke of mites (<i>syrones</i>) that lived
between the flesh and skin (<i>carnem et cutem</i>), particularly on the hands.
The mites’ prediliction for hands is emphasised in their name in the English
vernacular: hand-worm. The exact location of the mites on the skin was further
specified by Guillaume Rondelet (1507-1566), regius professor of medicine at
Montpellier, who stated that<i> cyrones</i> lived <i>semper intra cutim et cuticulam</i>
(always between the dermis and epidermis) and were extracted by women with the
aid of a needle. Other early modern medical authors, such Daniel Sennert (1572-1637),
mention needles being used to remove them. Although they might not have
considered as causes of scabies in particular, mites, like fleas or lice, were
one of the many causes of an itchy body in the early modern period. </p><p><br/></p><p>KWM</p>

                      <h3>On Snake Bile and Asiatic Leprosy</h3> <p>

<div class="page-content">
    
    
    <p>In
January 1699, Willem ten Rhijne (1647–1700), a physician in the services of the
Dutch East India Company, received a letter from his correspondent Georg Joseph
Kamel (1661–1706), a Jesuit pharmacist stationed in Spanish Manila. In the
letter, Kamel thanked his colleague for the advice on how to treat Asiatic
leprosy with a remedy prepared from snake bile. Whilst leprosy had been
receding in Europe throughout the early modern period, this ancient biblical
disease continued to wreak havoc on colonial practitioners. Its Asiatic form
was considered particularly severe and, even worse, it was largely unfamiliar
to European physicians.</p><p><br/></p>
    
    
    
    <p>Having
devoted more than two decades of his life to studying this terrible disease,
ten Rhijne was a leading authority on Asiatic leprosy. Some ten years prior to his
exchange with Kamel, he published a ‘Treatise on Asiatic Leprosy’<i> </i>(<i>Verhandelinge
van de Asiatise Melaatsheid</i>, 1687), which provides rich insights into seventeenth-century
colonial medical care and skin diseases in southeast Asia. Although ten Rhijne
had written all his previous works in Latin, he chose his vernacular Dutch for
this treatise. Indeed, he was addressing a wider audience, including colonial
officials, rather than just men of letters. With the disease “having in a few
years’ time spread to such a degree that one would fear this evil growing even
more grave” (p. xi), ten Rhijne was writing in direct response to the growing
fear of the spread of Asiatic leprosy in Java. Difficult to diagnose correctly
and even harder to cure, ten Rhijne offered a detailed discourse on its
nosology, symptoms, causes and treatment, including non-European observations
and therapies. His understanding of the disease was Galenic and, at every step,
ten Rhijne invoked his rich direct experience with the disease.</p><p><br/></p>

    </div>
    
</div>
    
    
    
    <p>In that respect, he had plenty
to draw on. In 1677, he was appointed a regent in the leprosy house of Angké,
located just outside the Batavia walls, and he later became the chief inspector
of leprosy control in the capital, where he was charged with diagnosing people
suspected of carrying the disease. It was also ten Rhijne who designated the
island of Purmerend in the Batavia bay as the new site of isolation in 1679,
when the Angké leprosarium was found too close for comfort to the city walls. In
ten Rhijne’s words, “this [Asiatic] form is very infectious and hideous” and posed
serious health risks to the colony (p. 22). As it had long been customary with
infectious diseases, isolation was the main solution and also a necessity: to “protect
and save the healthy,” the sufferers were to be “sent far out of sight of the
uninfected” (p. xii). Ten Rhijne described the disease explicitly as “frightful
to see and hear,” with the lepers increasingly covered in ill-smelling ulcers and
hampered in their speech as the decay progressed (p. 34). Such unpleasant sensory
perceptions could have had medical consequences too, polluting the air with
corrosive vapours and provoking shock and fear in the onlookers. This would
pose a particular threat to pregnant women. According to the idea of maternal
imagination, anything a pregnant woman saw could be imprinted on her unborn
child and lead to a monstrous birth. The stigma that accompanied the disease
was indeed severe and, out of compassion, ten Rhijne chose to protect the
anonymity of his patients. It was not only leprosy sufferers who were removed to
Purmerend for the greater good of the colony: anyone found ‘unsightly’ enough, including
those infected with different skin and venereal diseases, could fall victim to
the Dutch policy.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Just as with other forms of
leprosy, ten Rhijne ascribed the origins of the Asiatic strain to poisonous
vapours, which would build up in the entrails, before beginning to affect the
skin and its excrements (hair and nails) and progressively pervade and destroy
the entire body. Ten Rhijne speculated that “even a simple constipation may
lead to leprosy,” yet the exact cause of the disease remained shrouded in
mystery (p. 16). Ten Rhijne named several factors that increased the risk of
infection, including poverty and the associated lack of hygiene, as well as the
consumption of certain foods. He advised avoiding eating too much fish and
seafood, sharp spices and meat. Overindulgence in sexual intercourse, especially
with menstruating women and leprosy sufferers, was also deemed to be
particularly perilous. All the worse, in the early stages of the disease, some sufferers
were found to “have excellent appetite and be very sensual, of which we have seen deplorable
and offensive examples” (p. 30). Ten Rhijne offered a strongly moralising and
sexualised portrayal of the disease, which he associated explicitly with non-Europeans
and slaves, among whom he found the affliction to be particularly prevalent. Such
cases were subject to strict isolation; however, Dutch colonists – at least
those better off – could simply move outside the city walls or even return home
to receive treatment in Europe. This was the case for the Dutch surgeon, Pieter
van Campen. Having been diagnosed with the illness, he was allowed to continue
his work at Purmerend until the next ship took him and his entire family back
to Europe.</p>

</div>
    
    
    
    <p><br/></p><p>When discussing the remedies against
this ‘great evil’, ten Rhijne expressed his dissatisfaction with standard methods
of treatment. This was perhaps the reason behind his experiments with local
remedies, including snake bile; after all, local substances were commonly
considered to be specific to local diseases. Animal bile was a staple
ingredient in Chinese and Japanese medicine: Li Shizhen’s renowned ‘Compendium
of Materia Medica (<i>Bencao Gangmu</i>, 1578) mentioned more than thirty
different kinds, from domesticated animals, such as the ox and pig, to larger beasts
including the elephant, tiger and shark. In addition to snake bile, horseshoe
crab bile was also recommended for leprosy. It was probably no accident that both
of these animals shed their skin, unlike any other source of bile listed. Here,
we can see how analogies between the human and the animal world were reflected
in the method of medical treatment. Ten Rhijne may have learned of this remedy
during his stay in Dejima (1674–1676), the Dutch trading post in the Nagasaki
bay, or perhaps from a Chinese or local colleague in Batavia. Just as the
Europeans, the Chinese considered “inner or malignant vapours to be the real originators”
of leprosy and explained the disease in causal terms (p. 20). Whilst it is
important to remember that commensurable ideas did not necessarily guarantee a
shared understanding, these overlaps may have facilitated ten Rhijne’s decision
to test and adopt the remedy. In colonial contexts, different medical
traditions could easily become entangled, especially with death and contagion
looming in the air.</p>

those better off – could simply move outside the city walls or even return home
to receive treatment in Europe. This was the case for the Dutch surgeon, Pieter
van Campen. Having been diagnosed with the illness, he was allowed to continue
his work at Purmerend until the next ship took him and his entire family back
to Europe.</p>

    <p><br/></p><p>When discussing the remedies against
this ‘great evil’, ten Rhijne expressed his dissatisfaction with standard methods
of treatment. This was perhaps the reason behind his experiments with local
remedies, including snake bile; after all, local substances were commonly
considered to be specific to local diseases. Animal bile was a staple
ingredient in Chinese and Japanese medicine: Li Shizhen’s renowned ‘Compendium
of Materia Medica (<i>Bencao Gangmu</i>, 1578) mentioned more than thirty
different kinds, from domesticated animals, such as the ox and pig, to larger beasts
including the elephant, tiger and shark. In addition to snake bile, horseshoe
crab bile was also recommended for leprosy. It was probably no accident that both
of these animals shed their skin, unlike any other source of bile listed. Here,
we can see how analogies between the human and the animal world were reflected
in the method of medical treatment. Ten Rhijne may have learned of this remedy
during his stay in Dejima (1674–1676), the Dutch trading post in the Nagasaki
bay, or perhaps from a Chinese or local colleague in Batavia. Just as the
Europeans, the Chinese considered “inner or malignant vapours to be the real originators”
of leprosy and explained the disease in causal terms (p. 20). Whilst it is
important to remember that commensurable ideas did not necessarily guarantee a
shared understanding, these overlaps may have facilitated ten Rhijne’s decision
to test and adopt the remedy. In colonial contexts, different medical
traditions could easily become entangled, especially with death and contagion
looming in the air.</p>
