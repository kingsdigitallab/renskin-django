                      <h3>Embalming</h3> <p>

<div class="page-content">
    
    
    <p>From the early 14th century, Europe
witnessed the emergence of a series of parallel practices of dissecting,
opening, and embalming the human body within a variety of different contexts. From
the legal practice of autopsy to medical anatomy, and from the embalming of members
of wealthy and powerful families to the opening of saints' bodies in search
of relics, a wide range of ways of handling a cadaver became the subject of
knowledge and expertise. There is no doubt that such practices could evoke negative
and horrified reactions amongst contemporaries, who were concerned with the fate of the resurrected body and feared for the revival of the recently dead. Such thoughts are well documented by late medieval
stories of corpses that rose from their graves to terrorise communities. These ideas were far more prevalent in northern than in southern regions.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>One particularly interesting case study is when considering papal bodies. These special bodies underwent particular rituals and funerary ceremonies.
The more superficial layers of the papal corpse became the focus of special
attention. The first complete funerary ceremonial book dates back to the 13th
century. In this, Peter d’Ameil, the archbishop of Narbonne, describes the nine days (<i>novena</i>) of funerary rituals that accompanied a pope’s death. It reveals the stages of how the body moved from his room to the chapel and finally to the
church, where a public ritual took place. To allow for the these papal bodies to be exposed for nine
days, they had to be carefully embalmed.</p>

<p><br/></p>

<p>Paleopathologists and paleobotanists have begun to
study the remains of the mummies of Renaissance noblemen and -women. By the
17<sup>th</sup> century, the famous Neapolitan barber-surgeon Cinzio D’Amato felt
confident enough to open his handbook with a description of the best technique
to embalm a human body in order for the skin to shine even after death.</p>

<p><br/></p>

<p>'Just as Physicians protect the living from the
violence of illnesses and other accidents' – he wrote – 'in the same way they
also protect the dead bodies of those who became famous for their excellence in
letters, arms, or for other merits from putrefaction. And since Physicians
often entrust this work to the faithful Barbers, it is necessary that barbers
understand well the art and manners of embalming bodies. They must master
perfectly the science and practice of this procedure, either through the
anatomists’ demonstrations, or through the teaching of some experienced
practitioner.' D’Amato then lists all the excellent <i>Signori</i> whose bodies he embalmed in Naples.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>D’Amato gives two recipes - one for an embalming powder
and one for a balm - that include ingredients such as myrrh, cinnamon, lavender, and
thyme. Clearly, one of the main goals of embalming was to make the body smell
fragrant. The practitioner had to empty the viscera from the cadaver, filling it with perfumed stoop and balms, and then smooth, anoint, perfume, and soften the
skin. Once the body had been emptied of its organs and filled instead with perfumed matter,
it had to be wrapped in a waxed and warm sheet and then 'dipped' in pitch. Only at this point it could be cleaned and presented in public. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>But the solemn art of the embalmer was related in to the practices of lower kinds of artisans. In the two recipes and the brief
description of the technique, D’Amato explains that once the internal organs
are removed, the embalmer must apply his powder 'just like we do when we put
salt on a pig’s flesh' – something that butchers and meat-sellers were accustomed to do.</p><p><br/></p><p>PS</p><p><br/></p><p>Further Reading:</p><p></p><ul><li>Katharine Park, 'The Criminal and the Saintly Body: Autopsy and Dissection in Renaissance Italy', <i>Renaissance Quarterly</i>, 47. 1 (1994): 1–33<br/></li><li>Valentina

<div class="page-content">
    
    
    <p>Cabinets of
curiosities were collections of the marvellous, and an armadillo specimen was
something that no self-respecting collector could do without. A survey of the catalogues listing the contents from 10 cabinets
of curiosities, dating from the late sixteenth to the early seventeenth centuries, reveals that the armadillo was by the far the most popular of all quadrupeds. Engravings of such collections show invariably an armadillo either perched on a shelf or hanging on the
wall (see figure and detail below of Ole Worm's 'Museum Wormianum'). Established in 1672, the museum for the Royal Society, which was based in Gresham College, had
not one but three armadillos. These specimens each showcased a different species, all described in Nehemiah Grew’s 1681 catalogue as ‘a great shell’d hedghog’, a
‘pigheaded armadillo’, and a ‘weesle-headed armadillo’.</p><p><br/></p><p>The armadillo’s
desirability can be attributed mostly to three factors. First, it (just as the pangolin) remained a puzzle to early modern natural historians due to the fact that it was covered
with a set of plates (the carapace), seemingly likening it to
an armoured horse. Second, it
was confusing to classify. Various authors claimed that it resembled different
animals, such as a pig, a rabbit, or a hedgehog.</p><p><br/></p><p>Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo (1478-1557) remarked that the armadillo was the size of a little dog and had peculiar
‘lizard-like skin’ where it was not covered in plates like an armoured horse. He also added that they were delicious to eat! When the naturalist Pierre Belon was travelling through Turkey and the Levant in the 1540s, he spotted an armadillo
specimen for sale in the market of Constantinople. He described it as 'a kind
of Brazilian hedgehog; for it curls up in its scales as a hedgehog curls up in
its spines. It is no larger than a medium-sized piglet; and indeed it is a
species of pig, with similar legs, trotters and muzzle. It has already been
seen in France, living on grain and fruit'. The sixteenth-century naturalist
Francisco Hernández likened it to 'the
size of a Maltese terrier, but with a much longer tail. The paws are like a
hedgehog’s, and so is the snout, through it is narrower and longer. This animal
is protected all over by its hard shield of individual, moveable plates, with
which it can cover itself in a ball. The ears are like a mouse’s but longer and
much thinner; the long, nodular rounded tail, is also covered with plates; the
white belly is covered with soft skin like a human’s, with quite long, thin,
sparse hairs'.</p><p></p>

The Nahuatl-language text of the <i>Codex Florentinus</i>, written by Bernardino de Sahagún with the assistance of Nahua students, uses similarly a mix of different animals to explain how 'it is called ayotochtli because its head is just like a rabbit’s; the ears are pointed long; the muzzle stubby. And its hands, its feet are just like a rabbit’s. It has a shell; like the turtle it goes enveloped in its shell [in which it goes protecting itself]. Its shell is not bone, but <i>rather like scales, very strong, very firm, solid, hard'.</i></p><p><br/></p><p>The third reason for this creature's popularity was one of practicality. The Swiss natural historian Conrad Gessner (1516-1565) explained that it was 'easily transported from distant regions, because nature has armed it with a hard skin' so that the 'flesh inside can be easily taken out without any harm to the original shape'. Thus, the armadillo (or at least just its shell) could easily be stuffed and transported across long distances without suffering too much damage, all the while keeping its original shape. Similarly, Belon commented that 'since it is kept filled with stuffing (for it is covered with hard skin) some have called it an ichneumon [mongoose] but that is wrong, for this animal has nothing of the nature of an ichneumon [...] The reason why this animal is commonly to be seen in cabinets of curiosities is that nature has armed it with a hard skin and large scales in the manner of a corslet, so that its flesh can readily be removed without losing anything of its true appearance’.</p><p><br/></p><p>So it was a mix of wonder and practicality that made the armadillo the era's must-have collectable!<br/></p><p><br/></p><p></p>

                      <h3>An Archer&#x27;s Wrist Guard</h3> <p>

<div class="page-content">
    
    
    <p>Archers’ wrist guards (or bracers) are worn by both men and
women to protect the delicate skin on the inside of the wrist and forearm,
which would otherwise be chafed by the bow string when an arrow is fired. This
early sixteenth-century archer’s wrist guard is made of fine leather using the <i>cuir bouilli</i> (boiled leather) technique. It is 12.4cm in length and the leather has been moulded to fit comfortably on a
man’s forearm. Rivet holes for a leather strap would have once ensured a tight fit
around the wrist and to keep sleeves well out of the way. As the average long
bow arrow of this period could travel at 115mph with a draw force of over
150lbs, any movement or displacement of the wrist guard could cause serious harm
to the wearer or even hamper the trajectory of the arrow. </p><p><br/></p>

<p>The section of the wrist guard that would have covered the
upper forearm is incised or stamped with raised decoration of a crowned
Tudor Rose and the inscription, ‘ihc helpe’, or ‘Jesus help’. On the part that protected the lower
wrist and forearm, the leather has been left plain to ensure smooth movement of the arrow and bow string. Although the guard is now almost black, the leather
bears small traces of gilding and red pigment, suggesting that originally it was an
expensive, colourful, and highly visible adornment on an archer’s arm. Several
simple leather wrist guards from the same period were found during the
excavations of the Tudor warship the<i> Mary Rose</i> (see blog post <a href="https://maryrose.org/blog/historical/museum-blogger/the-roses-of-the-mary-rose/">'The Roses of the <i>Mary Rose</i>'</a>). The costly nature of the materials used along with the Tudor Rose decoration suggests a connection to the Tudor court, where it may have been worn by either a nobleman or man-at-arms.</p><p><br/></p>

<p>The term <i>cuir bouilli</i> has Norman origins, although this
technique for shaping and hardening leather was developed much earlier. It involves using vegetable-tanned hides that have been soaked for a length of time (varying according to the nature of the leather) in cold water and then allowing them to drain until they are damp but not exuding water. In this state, the leather is soft and pliable, able to be stretched and moulded to form complex, three-dimensional
shapes before being decorated by modelling, incising, or with <i>repoussé
</i>work. The leather is then dried under carefully controlled heat conditions, as if dried too quickly or at too high a temperature it becomes brittle. Once completely
dry, it forms a permanent, hard-set material. The hard but resilient properties of leather resulting from the <i>cuir bouilli</i> technique were exploited widely for use in all types of protective skin guards,
including small objects such as thimbles. But it was employed in particular for
armour, examples of which can be found from the Roman to the early modern
period.</p>

    <p>We read in Chaucer’s <i>The Rime of Sir Thopas</i> how 'his jambeux [shin or leg guards] were of Quirboily', while images of leather or <i>cuir bouilli</i> armour can be seen in the fifteenth-century frescoes by Piero Della Francesca at the Basilica of St Francis in Arezzo, Italy.<br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Wrist guards as a form of skin protection were developed by virtually all civilisations in which the bow and arrow was used either for hunting or in combat, and they were made from many different materials and using different techniques. Images of wrist guards can be found on every continent and examples in ivory, stone, bone, and leather survive from early prehistory right up to the modern era. Images suggest that leather wrist guards were the most common, since unlike bone or stone, leather is flexible and allows the skin to move and breathe. Surviving examples are limited due to the biodegradable nature of the material. In societies where suitable animal hides were more scarce, such as parts of the Americas and the Pacific Islands, grasses and reeds were woven into tubular wrist guards. Protecting this small but delicate section of skin was, and remains, a concern that crossed geographical and temporal boundaries.</p><p><br/></p><p>JC</p><p><br/></p><p>Further Reading:</p><p></p><ul><li>John W.

                              <h3>An Archer&#x27;s Wrist Guard</h3> 

<div class="page-content">
    
    
    <p>Archers’ wrist guards (or bracers) are worn by both men and
women to protect the delicate skin on the inside of the wrist and forearm,
which would otherwise be chafed by the bow string when an arrow is fired. This
early sixteenth-century archer’s wrist guard is made of fine leather using the <i>cuir bouilli</i> (boiled leather) technique. It is 12.4cm in length and the leather has been moulded to fit comfortably on a
man’s forearm. Rivet holes for a leather strap would have once ensured a tight fit
around the wrist and to keep sleeves well out of the way. As the average long
bow arrow of this period could travel at 115mph with a draw force of over
150lbs, any movement or displacement of the wrist guard could cause serious harm
to the wearer or even hamper the trajectory of the arrow. </p><p><br/></p>

<p>The section of the wrist guard that would have covered the
upper forearm is incised or stamped with raised decoration of a crowned
Tudor Rose and the inscription, ‘ihc helpe’, or ‘Jesus help’. On the part that protected the lower
wrist and forearm, the leather has been left plain to ensure smooth movement of the arrow and bow string. Although the guard is now almost black, the leather
bears small traces of gilding and red pigment, suggesting that originally it was an
expensive, colourful, and highly visible adornment on an archer’s arm. Several
simple leather wrist guards from the same period were found during the
excavations of the Tudor warship the<i> Mary Rose</i> (see blog post <a href="https://maryrose.org/blog/historical/museum-blogger/the-roses-of-the-mary-rose/">'The Roses of the <i>Mary Rose</i>'</a>). The costly nature of the materials used along with the Tudor Rose decoration suggests a connection to the Tudor court, where it may have been worn by either a nobleman or man-at-arms.</p><p><br/></p>

<p>The term <i>cuir bouilli</i> has Norman origins, although this
technique for shaping and hardening leather was developed much earlier. It involves using vegetable-tanned hides that have been soaked for a length of time (varying according to the nature of the leather) in cold water and then allowing them to drain until they are damp but not exuding water. In this state, the leather is soft and pliable, able to be stretched and moulded to form complex, three-dimensional
shapes before being decorated by modelling, incising, or with <i>repoussé
</i>work. The leather is then dried under carefully controlled heat conditions, as if dried too quickly or at too high a temperature it becomes brittle. Once completely
dry, it forms a permanent, hard-set material. The hard but resilient properties of leather resulting from the <i>cuir bouilli</i> technique were exploited widely for use in all types of protective skin guards,
including small objects such as thimbles. But it was employed in particular for
armour, examples of which can be found from the Roman to the early modern
period.</p>

    <p>We read in Chaucer’s <i>The Rime of Sir Thopas</i> how 'his jambeux [shin or leg guards] were of Quirboily', while images of leather or <i>cuir bouilli</i> armour can be seen in the fifteenth-century frescoes by Piero Della Francesca at the Basilica of St Francis in Arezzo, Italy.<br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Wrist guards as a form of skin protection were developed by virtually all civilisations in which the bow and arrow was used either for hunting or in combat, and they were made from many different materials and using different techniques. Images of wrist guards can be found on every continent and examples in ivory, stone, bone, and leather survive from early prehistory right up to the modern era. Images suggest that leather wrist guards were the most common, since unlike bone or stone, leather is flexible and allows the skin to move and breathe. Surviving examples are limited due to the biodegradable nature of the material. In societies where suitable animal hides were more scarce, such as parts of the Americas and the Pacific Islands, grasses and reeds were woven into tubular wrist guards. Protecting this small but delicate section of skin was, and remains, a concern that crossed geographical and temporal boundaries.</p><p><br/></p><p>JC</p><p><br/></p><p>Further Reading:</p><p></p><ul><li>John W.

                      <h3>Saddles</h3> <p>

<div class="page-content">
    
    
    <p>References to saddles in Shakespeare's works are not that frequent. In fact, given the cultural power this object possessed, it is surprising to find only 17 occurrences. When Shakespeare did mention saddles, the context and phrasing was limited to only a small range of possibilities. Two of the references are both found within <i>The Comedy of Errors </i>and<i> </i>relate to a saddler. Eight refer to saddles as objects, including an ‘old mothy saddle’ (<i>Taming of the Shrew, </i>Act 3 Scene 2) and
an ‘ass’s pack saddle’ (<i>Coriolanus, </i>Act
2 Scene 1). The remaining seven references, more than a third of Shakespeare’s
very few references, relate to the act of ‘saddling’: in <i>Edward III</i>,<i> </i>Douglas asks Jeremy to ‘saddle [his] bonny black’ (Act 1
Scene 2); in King Lear, the title character exclaims ‘Darkness and devils!
Saddle my horses; call my train together!’ (Act 1 Scene 4); and in <i>Richard III</i>, Richard, Duke of York asks
of a servant ‘Give me my boots; I say, saddle my horse’ (Act 5 Scene 2).
Writing amidst the tussles of the Renaissance, what did Shakespeare mean for
the horses of his plays to be ‘saddled’? 
</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The saddle depicted here, held by the <a href="https://www.shakespeare.org.uk/">Shakespeare Birthplace Trust</a>, is dated to 1550 and would have been part of this act of ‘saddling’ during Shakespeare’s
time of writing. Complete with a wool-stuffed seat and pommel, and a quilted
velvet exterior, the saddle would have offered a soft point of outward-facing
engagement for riders. However, the underside of this object – the surface
which touched the back of the horse – was lined with a smooth and soft leather. Fast forward
to the traditional close of the early modern period in the eighteenth century when many of the
material contexts and technologies for riding would have changed, nevertheless the prevalence of this object did not. In 1794, <i>The law respecting horses </i>granted saddle horses a separate legal
status, building on the earlier comments of Thomas Hale that: </p>

<p> </p>

<p>'One thing I shall observe to the
farmer, which is, that he avoid that very common fault, the making the horse
serve for different uses. Nothing is so wrong. Let him never put a saddle upon
his cart or drought horses, for it alters them in their pace, and renders them
awkward and troublesome in their ordinary and proper labours.'</p>

<p> </p>

<p>By the end of the early modern period then, ‘saddling’ a
horse was no small act. It demarcated this animal as separate from others of
its species and had to be done with due care and attention, to protect the
animal from harm. Throughout the early modern period, British society and
culture was characterised by significant scientific, commercial, and industrial
changes. But the function of a saddle remained constant. As examples in a range
of British collections show, the introduction of a padded panel to the
underside of saddles made sure that the skin of horses did not bear harm
through the act of riding. By the seventeenth century authors such as Gervase
Markham used literary forms of communicating knowledge to ensure that riders
understood the risks to a horse’s skin posed by a poorly-fitting saddle. This rhetoric was revived by Antoine de l’Etang in the early eighteenth century.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>If being ‘saddled’ was a call to arms for horses for
Shakespeare’s characters, the object itself served two interrelated functions.
On the one hand, it signified that a horse was ‘in use’ and a part of particular
human activities. On the other, its careful use was important for protecting the
skin of this crucially important animal companion.</p><p><br/></p><p>Tom Rusbridge</p><p><br/></p><p>Further Reading:</p><p></p><ul><li>J.W. Waterer, <i>Leather

                      <h3>A Nuremberg Thimble</h3> <p>

<div class="page-content">
    
    
    <p>Small, ordinary and ubiquitous thimbles are not usually
considered as ‘armour’, yet as a defensive outer layer or covering they have
been ‘armouring’ or protecting humans’ fingers and thumbs from prehistory to
the present day.  The term ‘thimble’ is derived
from the Old Norse word <i>þumall</i>
meaning the thumb of a glove, and the earliest thimbles are assumed to have
been made of leather, consisting of a basic, bell-shaped sheath worn at the end
of the finger or thumb in order to push a sewing needle.  Traditional Eskimo women used sealskin
thimbles, which they kept safe by slipping them onto thimble guards that were sometimes
fashioned in the shape of a seal.  Due to
its ephemeral nature, however, very few early leather thimbles survive.
Thimbles have also been made in an enormous variety of styles and materials,
from bone, ivory, porcelain, to base and precious metals.  And, while chiefly associated with female,
domestic needlework, thimbles or ‘thumbstalls’ are worn by both men and women,
as they are an essential tool for many occupations; for example, cobblers,
saddlers, chandlers and fishermen all use thimbles.</p><p><br/></p>

<p>The design of European metal thimbles, like the human fingers
they protect, has changed little, and bronze thimbles found in the excavations
of Pompeii and Herculaneum, buried by the volcanic eruption of 79 CE are almost
identical to their modern-day counterparts. Early metal thimbles known as
‘skeps’ or ‘acorn tops’, were either cast or simply hammered into a mould, and
the end closed by pinching or pleating the metal. The characteristic
indentations, which allow for easier purchase on the needle head, were hammered
in by hand, often in a spiral formation. 
Open ended thimbles, called thimble or tailors’ rings had an open end,
leaving the sensitive, finger-tip free to pick up pins or delicate fabrics. A
thimble ring can be seen in the foreground of a portrait of Constanza Caetani
(c.1469-1489), a member of the Medici family. The inclusion of sewing tools in
this image demonstrated the sitter’s virtue; being occupied by sewing was
considered an important female quality, and the thimble armoured not only her
fingers, but her mind too (see image 1).</p><p><br/></p>

    <p>During the early sixteenth-century advancements in founding
techniques allowed European thimbles to be made in two parts, consisting of
a taller cone shape with a flatter cap.  Metal
technology was further developed by workers in Nuremberg who pioneered the
manufacture of copper alloys and technologies to produce metal sheets of a
uniform thickness that could be fashioned into a light, gold-coloured brass,
which was ideal for thimble production. Moreover the regularity of the metal
meant there was a greater scope for elegant, filigree decoration and design.  From this period the designs for some
thimbles, particularly ones made from precious metals, became very elaborate
and increasingly included polychrome enamels or precious stones.  An engraving by Johan Theodor de Bry
(1528-1598) shows a design for three thimbles in profile, two of which are
decorated with tiny biblical scenes (see image 2).</p><p><br/></p>

</div>
    
    
    
    <p>From the latter half of the sixteenth century Nuremberg thimbles,
known as <i>fingerh</i><i>ütter
</i>or ‘finger hats’ dominated the market. It is estimated that 4.5 million Nuremberg
thimbles were produced and exported all over Europe. There is even some
evidence suggesting that Nuremberg thimble makers had ambitions on a global export
market, as Nuremberg thimbles formed part of the cargo of the Portuguese merchant
ship, the <i>Bom Jesus</i>, which sank off
Namibia’s notorious coastline in 1533 on its outward journey to the Far East. </p><p><br/></p>

<p>Elaborate gold, silver or silver-gilt thimbles, such as the
one shown in the main image, were frequently given as gifts, and like
ceremonial or tournament armour their function was probably more decorative
than utilitarian. Elizabeth I both gave and received presents of thimbles and
an inventory of her possessions records ‘a nedell case of cristall garnysshed
with silver gilt, with two thimbles in it’. But there are numerous examples of
gifts of thimbles in more humble establishments and the large amounts of
domestic sewing that was required during the early modern period meant that
they were regarded as a very acceptable present.  During the English civil wars sermons
preached by Hugh Peter (1598-1660) even encouraged women to give small gifts of
gold or silver to the Parliamentary army, a practice which earned them the
sobriquet of the ‘Thimble and Bodkin army’ – quite literally a case of turning
thimbles into armour.</p>

<div class="page-content">
    
    
    <p>Small, ordinary and ubiquitous thimbles are not usually
considered as ‘armour’, yet as a defensive outer layer or covering they have
been ‘armouring’ or protecting humans’ fingers and thumbs from prehistory to
the present day.  The term ‘thimble’ is derived
from the Old Norse word <i>þumall</i>
meaning the thumb of a glove, and the earliest thimbles are assumed to have
been made of leather, consisting of a basic, bell-shaped sheath worn at the end
of the finger or thumb in order to push a sewing needle.  Traditional Eskimo women used sealskin
thimbles, which they kept safe by slipping them onto thimble guards that were sometimes
fashioned in the shape of a seal.  Due to
its ephemeral nature, however, very few early leather thimbles survive.
Thimbles have also been made in an enormous variety of styles and materials,
from bone, ivory, porcelain, to base and precious metals.  And, while chiefly associated with female,
domestic needlework, thimbles or ‘thumbstalls’ are worn by both men and women,
as they are an essential tool for many occupations; for example, cobblers,
saddlers, chandlers and fishermen all use thimbles.</p><p><br/></p>

<p>The design of European metal thimbles, like the human fingers
they protect, has changed little, and bronze thimbles found in the excavations
of Pompeii and Herculaneum, buried by the volcanic eruption of 79 CE are almost
identical to their modern-day counterparts. Early metal thimbles known as
‘skeps’ or ‘acorn tops’, were either cast or simply hammered into a mould, and
the end closed by pinching or pleating the metal. The characteristic
indentations, which allow for easier purchase on the needle head, were hammered
in by hand, often in a spiral formation. 
Open ended thimbles, called thimble or tailors’ rings had an open end,
leaving the sensitive, finger-tip free to pick up pins or delicate fabrics. A
thimble ring can be seen in the foreground of a portrait of Constanza Caetani
(c.1469-1489), a member of the Medici family. The inclusion of sewing tools in
this image demonstrated the sitter’s virtue; being occupied by sewing was
considered an important female quality, and the thimble armoured not only her
fingers, but her mind too (see image 1).</p><p><br/></p>

    <p>During the early sixteenth-century advancements in founding
techniques allowed European thimbles to be made in two parts, consisting of
a taller cone shape with a flatter cap.  Metal
technology was further developed by workers in Nuremberg who pioneered the
manufacture of copper alloys and technologies to produce metal sheets of a
uniform thickness that could be fashioned into a light, gold-coloured brass,
which was ideal for thimble production. Moreover the regularity of the metal
meant there was a greater scope for elegant, filigree decoration and design.  From this period the designs for some
thimbles, particularly ones made from precious metals, became very elaborate
and increasingly included polychrome enamels or precious stones.  An engraving by Johan Theodor de Bry
(1528-1598) shows a design for three thimbles in profile, two of which are
decorated with tiny biblical scenes (see image 2).</p><p><br/></p>

    <p>From the latter half of the sixteenth century Nuremberg thimbles,
known as <i>fingerh</i><i>ütter
</i>or ‘finger hats’ dominated the market. It is estimated that 4.5 million Nuremberg
thimbles were produced and exported all over Europe. There is even some
evidence suggesting that Nuremberg thimble makers had ambitions on a global export
market, as Nuremberg thimbles formed part of the cargo of the Portuguese merchant
ship, the <i>Bom Jesus</i>, which sank off
Namibia’s notorious coastline in 1533 on its outward journey to the Far East. </p><p><br/></p>

<p>Elaborate gold, silver or silver-gilt thimbles, such as the
one shown in the main image, were frequently given as gifts, and like
ceremonial or tournament armour their function was probably more decorative
than utilitarian. Elizabeth I both gave and received presents of thimbles and
an inventory of her possessions records ‘a nedell case of cristall garnysshed
with silver gilt, with two thimbles in it’. But there are numerous examples of
gifts of thimbles in more humble establishments and the large amounts of
domestic sewing that was required during the early modern period meant that
they were regarded as a very acceptable present.  During the English civil wars sermons
preached by Hugh Peter (1598-1660) even encouraged women to give small gifts of
gold or silver to the Parliamentary army, a practice which earned them the
sobriquet of the ‘Thimble and Bodkin army’ – quite literally a case of turning
thimbles into armour.</p>

                      <h3>Dog skin gloves</h3> <p>

<div class="page-content">
    
    
    <p>The early modern period saw a vogue for dog
skin gloves, which were highly praised due to the softness and flexibility of
the leather. They could be worn by both men and women in all ranks of society.
Thomas Dekker’s play <i>If it be not good,
the Diuel is in it</i> (London, 1612) has the city water-bearers wearing them
and the Dutch jurist Hugo Grotius (1583 - 1645) wrote an epigram on wearing a
dog-skin glove that was perfumed with the musk of a civet cat. The account book
of Lady Anne Clifford (1590-1676), kept between 1600 and 1602, recounts the
purchase of gloves, including a pair made of dog skin for the sum of two
shillings. An issue of <i>Tatler</i> for
1710 includes among the items in a cabinet ‘three pair of oiled dog-skin
gloves’.</p><p><br/></p>

<p>                The
connection between the flayed and tanned skin of a dog and the real (and
symbolic) animal itself is underlined by two letters written in 1594 by the
Spanish exile Antonio Pérez. They were addressed to the sister and mother
of  Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex:
Penelope, Lady Rich, and Lettice Knollys. In both letters he attempted
to curry favour and dog-skin gloves play a major part. In the letter to
Penelope Rich, he laments his inability to provide her with dog-skin gloves
that he suggests flaying himself instead for the gloves. Pérez
links the faithfulness of dogs to his own fidelity to the earl's family,
and the soft pliability of dog skin to his own, ending the letter with ‘The
gloves are of dog-skin, although they are mine; because I consider myself a dog
and (like a dog) may Your Ladyship keep me in faith and love at your service’.
He signed it ‘Your Ladyship’s flayed dog’ (perro dessolado), and the letter in Spanish
also plays on the similarity between his own name and the Spanish for dog. The
same metaphors are used again in his letter to Lettice Knollys, which
accompanied a pair of perfumed dog-skin gloves: ‘Lady, the fabric is of
dog (skin), the animal praised among all others for fidelity. Of such I beg
Your Ladyship to give me name and place in her grace and service. And I do not
disdain it, for I have seen dogs in places very favoured by ladies. And when I
am unable to be of any service, maybe my skin will be good enough for gloves’
(signed ‘Dog and Servant of Your Ladyship’).</p><p><br/></p>

<p>                Gloves
were a traditional and very popular gift in the period and Peter Stallybrass
and Ann Rosalind Jones interpret these letters in the context of gloves as a
sexual metaphor, as a replacement for the missing lover. However, Erica Fudge
has emphasised the need to underline the fact that “in his use of the conceit of the dog-skin
gloves Pérez is not only displaying his loyalty, he is also what we might term becoming
doggish; he is being made canine”. In both letters Pérez is not just talking
about any gloves but emphasizing that they are made of dog skin and allotting
desired canine qualities to himself. The living faithful dog, skinned and
tanned, seems to be still present in the gloves.</p><p>  </p>

<p>                The
connection between dog skin gloves and fidelity appears as a literary motif
elsewhere. In John Fletcher and William Shakespeare’s <i>Two Noble Kinsmen</i>, the ‘Second countryman’ grumbles after his
Cicely does not turn up that ‘The next gloves that I give her shall be dog
skin’ (Act 3 Scene 6). Presumably the faithfulness of the dog, disembodied as a
gloves, will influence or change Cicely’s behaviour once worn.  The fact that these gloves were made of dogs,
a species also kept as beloved pets, guard dogs and hunting hounds, did not go
unremarked. The comic play <i>The London
chaunticleres </i>(1659) has one character sniggering at the idea of the canine
guardian of the Underworld being perturbed by the sight of them: ‘And how wou'd
Cerberus take it, to see one come to Hell with a dog-skin pair of Gloves?’.
Thomas Brasbridge’s 1578 <i>Treatise of the
pestilence</i> even claimed that a glover in Oxford died of the plague (along
with his entire family) due to his wife bringing into the house a dog skin, a
case of dead skin touching living human skin and transmitting contagion.           </p><p><br/></p>

<p>                The
gloves were not only worn as a fashion item to cover the wearer’s hands but
also were used cosmetically. The gloves would be worn at night, often in
conjunction with a thickly plastered ointment on the skin itself, to soften hands.
 Dr Walter Pope, a late
seventeenth-century astronomer and translator of Miguel de Cervantes, added a
line in his English version of <i>El Amante Liberal
</i>not in the original Cervantes on ‘Dog-skin Gloves to lye in a Nights to
preserve thy effeminate, white, soft Hands’ (<i>Select novels the first six
written in Spanish</i>,
London 1694). In Alexander Oldy’s novel <i>The
female gallant</i> (London, 1692) in which one Philandra’s hands are described
as  ‘exceeding fair, yet, now, by this
white,---as--- (Ah! wou'd my Shirt, ay, or my Crevat, were as white!) the
falling Snow, for she had us'd a peculiar Ointment, and lay in Dog-skin-Gloves,
with her Arms extended over her Head all this while, unless when any Visitors
came.’ And even in the eighteenth century the author Jonathan Swift satirises a
women’s dressing room that includes puppy-water and ‘There night-gloves made of
Tripsy’s hide, / Bequeathed by Tripsy when she died’.</p><p><br/></p>

<p>                Apart from their fashionable and
cosmetic implications, dog skin gloves could also be used for medical purposes.
The English surgeon Richard Wiseman suggested wearing them as a preservative
method against chilblains in order to ‘cloath the Parts warm, that the Pores
may be open to give a breathing to the Humour to which purpose furred Gloves
and woollen Mittens and Socks are to be commended, also Dog-skin Gloves for the
poorer sort; the richer may have oiled Gloves’ (<i>Severall chirurgicall treatises,</i> London 1676).</p><p><br/></p>

<p>                Dog
skin gloves present us with an intriguing case study of trying to understand
the connection between a living valued animal and its disembodied skin, stripped
of flesh, but which could still retain its doggishness.</p>

perfect complexion was achieved through cosmetic rouge, but she was only
conforming to northern-European notions of Renaissance-female beauty, defined
by fair skin and smooth, unwrinkled cheeks suffused with a soft, rosy glow. The
many treatises on beauty published in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries
reinforced this trope, although they differed on the virtues of achieving it
through nature or artifice. Nonetheless, excessively red cheeks from over-exposure
to heat (either from the sun or indoor fires) was to be avoided as the primary cause

the ‘quintessence of beauty’, while on her cheeks ‘though shalt see the Lilly

                      <h3>Umbrellas</h3> <p>

<div class="page-content">
    
    
    <p><i>The quotidian umbrella was once considered an exotic
commodity primarily concerned with protecting the skin against sunburn.</i></p><p><i><br/></i></p>

<p>Modern-day umbrellas are most closely associated with rain,
but etymology reveals that the word originates from the Latin <i>ombre</i>
meaning shade and they were principally used to protect and cool skin from the
sun’s rays.  Umbrellas or parasols were
used by ancient civilisations in both Asia and Egypt, but their general
adoption in northern Europe dates from the middle of the seventeenth century,
although they were popular in sunnier climates from a much earlier period. Montaigne
commented on the use of umbrellas in Italy, and Thomas Coryate (<i>Crudities,</i>
1611) noted that:</p><p><br/></p>

<p><i>And many of them doe carry other fine things of a far
greater price, that will cost at the least a duckat, which they commonly call
in the Italian tongue umbrellas, that is, things which minister shadowve to
them for shelter against the scorching heate of the sunne. These are made of
leather, something answerable to the forme of a little cannopy, &amp; hooped in
the inside with divers little wooden hoopes that extend the umbrella in a
pretty large compasse. They are used especially by horsemen, who carry them in
their hands when they ride, fastening the end of the handle upon one of their
thighs, and they impart so large a shadow unto them, that it keepeth the heate
of the sunne from the upper parts of their bodies.</i></p><p><i><br/></i></p>

<p>This specific arrangement is illustrated on a ceramic plate
manufactured in Emilia, Italy during the seventeenth or eighteenth century
(image 1), which shows a gentleman rider holding an umbrella in his right hand
while his left holds the reins. Carrying an umbrella in this fashion was
probably used on leisurely outings; it appears cumbersome to a modern rider, but early modern reins and bits gave the
rider a great deal of control, which would make holding a sunshade in one hand
an easy prospect.</p><p><br/></p>

<p>Despite their presence in the Mediterranean, umbrellas were
not popularized in northern Europe until Dutch merchants began importing them
from Asia during the early part of the seventeenth century.  Early illustrations of umbrellas usually
associated them with exotic or oriental provenance. An etching by Christoph
Janmitzer (Nuremburg 1610) shows a putto riding a sea monster with an
elephant’s trunk and holding an umbrella (image 2).  Despite their obvious practical application, however,
the English remained suspicious, and umbrellas were initially regarded as
effeminate or even a potential health hazard. 
In Fynes Moryson’s <i>Itinerary</i> (1617) he cautioned that: <i>they
gathered the heate into a pyramid point from where it was cast down
perpendicularly upon the head</i>.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p>

    <p><br/></p><p>In England umbrellas remained an exotic curiosity throughout the seventeenth century.  An umbrella was recorded in John Tradescant’s <i>Museum Tradescantianum or Collection of Rarities</i> located in south Lambeth from 1608-1662. In June 1664 John Evelyn described umbrellas as: <i>fans like those our ladies use, but much larger, and with long handles, strangely carved and filled with Chinese characters</i>. It is not until the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries that umbrellas regularly feature in either English literature or imagery, where again their exotic origin is emphasized.  In Dryden’s tragedy <i>Don Sebastian, King of Portugal </i>(1690) Antonio informs Johayma, the Mufti’s wife: <i>I can carry your umbrella and fan your Ladyship, and cool you when you are too hot: in fine, no service either by day or by night shall come amiss to me</i>.  A contemporaneous example of a <i>chinoiserie</i> decorative panel attributed to Robert Robinson shows a Chinese dignitary riding on a fish under an umbrella (image 3). This type of decorative fantasy by a European artist was highly unusual as it preceded the mania for <i>chinoiserie </i>by nearly 30 years, and reveals the exotic character ascribed to umbrellas in this period.<br/></p><p><br/></p>

    <p>Early umbrellas had a heavy wooden frame with baleen stents that needed to be dried carefully or the whalebone was liable to crack, rendering them useless in wet weather. Daniel Defoe’s Robinson Crusoe (1719) makes himself an umbrella: <i>I covered it with skins the hair outwards, so that it cast off the rain like a penthouse, and kept off the sun so effectually, that I could walk out in the hottest of the weather with greater advantage than I could before in the coolest</i> – as a result heavy umbrellas were known as ‘Robinsons’.</p><p><br/></p><p>The first lightweight, rain-resistant umbrellas were introduced into Europe in 1710 by the Parisian merchant Jean Marius. They were waterproofed by painting a coating of oil on to silk, although this was liable to shed when wet and stain clothing. John Gay’s <i>Trivia or the Art of Walking the Streets of London</i> (1716): <i>Or, underneath th’ umbrella’s oily shed/Safe through the wet on clinking pattens tread/Let Persian dames th’umbrellas rich display/to guard their beauties from the sunny ray.</i></p><p><br/></p><p>In fact, the umbrella remained something of a rarity even at the end of the eighteenth century when in 1782 it was noted that Mr Jamieson, a surgeon, brought the first umbrella to Glasgow on his return from a trip to Paris. Modern, steel-ribbed, waterproof umbrellas were invented by Samuel Fox in 1852.</p><p><br/></p><p>For examples of early umbrellas see: The Olive Matthews Collection, Chertsey Museum; The Fashion Museum, Bath; and the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, London.</p><p><br/></p><p>Dr Juliet Claxton</p><p><br/></p><p>Title image/Image 1: Ceramic plate, Italy, ca. 17th-18th century,

<div class="page-content">
    
    
    <p><i>The quotidian umbrella was once considered an exotic
commodity primarily concerned with protecting the skin against sunburn.</i></p><p><i><br/></i></p>

<p>Modern-day umbrellas are most closely associated with rain,
but etymology reveals that the word originates from the Latin <i>ombre</i>
meaning shade and they were principally used to protect and cool skin from the
sun’s rays.  Umbrellas or parasols were
used by ancient civilisations in both Asia and Egypt, but their general
adoption in northern Europe dates from the middle of the seventeenth century,
although they were popular in sunnier climates from a much earlier period. Montaigne
commented on the use of umbrellas in Italy, and Thomas Coryate (<i>Crudities,</i>
1611) noted that:</p><p><br/></p>

<p><i>And many of them doe carry other fine things of a far
greater price, that will cost at the least a duckat, which they commonly call
in the Italian tongue umbrellas, that is, things which minister shadowve to
them for shelter against the scorching heate of the sunne. These are made of
leather, something answerable to the forme of a little cannopy, &amp; hooped in
the inside with divers little wooden hoopes that extend the umbrella in a
pretty large compasse. They are used especially by horsemen, who carry them in
their hands when they ride, fastening the end of the handle upon one of their
thighs, and they impart so large a shadow unto them, that it keepeth the heate
of the sunne from the upper parts of their bodies.</i></p><p><i><br/></i></p>

<p>This specific arrangement is illustrated on a ceramic plate
manufactured in Emilia, Italy during the seventeenth or eighteenth century
(image 1), which shows a gentleman rider holding an umbrella in his right hand
while his left holds the reins. Carrying an umbrella in this fashion was
probably used on leisurely outings; it appears cumbersome to a modern rider, but early modern reins and bits gave the
rider a great deal of control, which would make holding a sunshade in one hand
an easy prospect.</p><p><br/></p>

<p>Despite their presence in the Mediterranean, umbrellas were
not popularized in northern Europe until Dutch merchants began importing them
from Asia during the early part of the seventeenth century.  Early illustrations of umbrellas usually
associated them with exotic or oriental provenance. An etching by Christoph
Janmitzer (Nuremburg 1610) shows a putto riding a sea monster with an
elephant’s trunk and holding an umbrella (image 2).  Despite their obvious practical application, however,
the English remained suspicious, and umbrellas were initially regarded as
effeminate or even a potential health hazard. 
In Fynes Moryson’s <i>Itinerary</i> (1617) he cautioned that: <i>they
gathered the heate into a pyramid point from where it was cast down
perpendicularly upon the head</i>.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p>

    <p><br/></p><p>In England umbrellas remained an exotic curiosity throughout the seventeenth century.  An umbrella was recorded in John Tradescant’s <i>Museum Tradescantianum or Collection of Rarities</i> located in south Lambeth from 1608-1662. In June 1664 John Evelyn described umbrellas as: <i>fans like those our ladies use, but much larger, and with long handles, strangely carved and filled with Chinese characters</i>. It is not until the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries that umbrellas regularly feature in either English literature or imagery, where again their exotic origin is emphasized.  In Dryden’s tragedy <i>Don Sebastian, King of Portugal </i>(1690) Antonio informs Johayma, the Mufti’s wife: <i>I can carry your umbrella and fan your Ladyship, and cool you when you are too hot: in fine, no service either by day or by night shall come amiss to me</i>.  A contemporaneous example of a <i>chinoiserie</i> decorative panel attributed to Robert Robinson shows a Chinese dignitary riding on a fish under an umbrella (image 3). This type of decorative fantasy by a European artist was highly unusual as it preceded the mania for <i>chinoiserie </i>by nearly 30 years, and reveals the exotic character ascribed to umbrellas in this period.<br/></p><p><br/></p>

    <p>Early umbrellas had a heavy wooden frame with baleen stents that needed to be dried carefully or the whalebone was liable to crack, rendering them useless in wet weather. Daniel Defoe’s Robinson Crusoe (1719) makes himself an umbrella: <i>I covered it with skins the hair outwards, so that it cast off the rain like a penthouse, and kept off the sun so effectually, that I could walk out in the hottest of the weather with greater advantage than I could before in the coolest</i> – as a result heavy umbrellas were known as ‘Robinsons’.</p><p><br/></p><p>The first lightweight, rain-resistant umbrellas were introduced into Europe in 1710 by the Parisian merchant Jean Marius. They were waterproofed by painting a coating of oil on to silk, although this was liable to shed when wet and stain clothing. John Gay’s <i>Trivia or the Art of Walking the Streets of London</i> (1716): <i>Or, underneath th’ umbrella’s oily shed/Safe through the wet on clinking pattens tread/Let Persian dames th’umbrellas rich display/to guard their beauties from the sunny ray.</i></p><p><br/></p><p>In fact, the umbrella remained something of a rarity even at the end of the eighteenth century when in 1782 it was noted that Mr Jamieson, a surgeon, brought the first umbrella to Glasgow on his return from a trip to Paris. Modern, steel-ribbed, waterproof umbrellas were invented by Samuel Fox in 1852.</p><p><br/></p><p>For examples of early umbrellas see: The Olive Matthews Collection, Chertsey Museum; The Fashion Museum, Bath; and the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, London.</p><p><br/></p><p>Dr Juliet Claxton</p><p><br/></p><p>Title image/Image 1: Ceramic plate, Italy, ca. 17th-18th century,

                      <h3>Contagion, susceptible surfaces, and disinfection</h3> <p>

<div class="page-content">
    
    
    <p>During the early modern period, it
was very common to quarantine and disinfect goods shipped across the
Mediterranean. Lazzaretti - preventive quarantine centres - were established from
the fifteenth century onwards along the coast of the Italian and Balkan
peninsula, and later France, forming a strategical system in the fight against
the plague. Passengers and goods coming from infected or suspected lands (for
example, Ottoman and German lands were considered particularly dangerous) were isolated
and decontaminated in specific buildings using specific procedures. The need
for disinfection varied according to the type of goods. Depending on the
materiality of the surface, objects were declared “subject” to, or
“susceptible” of contagion.</p><p><br/></p>

<p>In early modern times, plague was believed to be caused
by a combination of different conditions (that could be astrological, religious
or linked to the local environment) and miasmata caused by humidity and rotting
substances. Plague was believed to be spread through bad air and through the so-called
‘seeds of the disease’ that could be preserved on contaminated surfaces. Giovanni
Gentili, Medical Officer of the Health Board in Livorno, listed in 1783 some of
the features of the objects which could retain more easily the contagion:
porosity, hairiness, coarseness, tenacity and viscosity. Another document from
the Health Board in Genoa described vividly the characteristics of dangerous
surfaces: ‘bloomy and crinkly outer shell … mushy, levelled,
wrinkled and uneven and unclean bodies’, silk that is ‘frayed, with threads in
relief’ and wood which was ‘old, worm-eaten, rugged, creased and uneven.’ Thus, textiles, raw cotton and wool, leather, fur, feathers, silk and
paper were considered among the most dangerous items. On the other hand, smooth
surfaces such as metal, wax, glass, china and polished hardwood were considered
safe from contagion.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Susceptible goods were disinfected and handled in different ways
according to their materials. The procedures were standardised across
lazzaretti, which shared regulations in order to follow a consistent and safe way
of dealing with potentially dangerous goods. In order to remove the ‘seeds’,
the bales of textiles were opened, and each item exposed to air was piled up;
the piled goods were then periodically turned. Scents, sulphur and smoke were
also used to fumigate the goods while paper was sprinkled with vinegar. The picture here shows how
bales of raw cotton were placed in the lazzaretto of Marseille on wooden racks in
the open air in order to be properly ventilated. A similar procedure and layout
were used for leather which was considered extremely dangerous and potentially
contagious. Indeed, Gentili also stressed that
processed and macerated vegetal and animal substances, above all if furry and
porous, were among the most dangerous. Furthermore, leather was shipped mostly from suspected lands (Ottoman
Empire and nearby areas) where plague outbreaks were always feared. As some
types of leather were shipped wet, many lazzaretti had big open spaces and open
sheds to spread out the goods for drying and ventilation. </p><p><br/></p>

<p>Fur was also considered extremely subject to contagion and ventilated
similarly to leather. However, not only pelts were disinfected in the
lazzaretto but living animals too. Poultry, cattle and any kind of animal that
was shipped across the Mediterranean (for instance, antelopes and ‘ferocious
animals’) needed to be disinfected and quarantined. Poultry and small animals were
commonly washed with water or vinegar. The lazzaretto in Ancona had a pool full
of seawater especially for this purpose and for disinfecting less dangerous
items. Animals were walked through the water and then released to the market. Feathers
were another dangerous item commonly disinfected inside lazzaretti: the bundles
of feathers were untied and then handled twice a day in order to ventilate
them. However, they were considered so dangerous that the staff had to use
waxed gloves, which were considered impermeable to the seeds of the disease. Indeed,
waxed robes were commonly used during plague outbreaks to protect people in
close contact with the sick, such as doctors and priests. Inside lazzaretti,
waxed shirts were worn by staff when opening bales of goods. Human skin too was
considered porous and permeable to the disease and needed to be protected. </p>
