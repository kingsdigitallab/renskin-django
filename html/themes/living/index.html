<div class="page-content">
    
    
    <p><i>Das Frauenbad </i>or <i>The Women's Bathhouse</i> (1496) by the Nuremberg artist Albrecht Dürer (1471-1528) is a pen drawing, probably made as a preparatory study for a print that was never executed. The drawing is a highly technical early demonstration of one-point linear perspective, which Dürer would later go on to
outline and explain in <i>Four books on
human proportion</i>. Featuring six women from
different points of view and in different poses, the drawing essentially models a female
body in the round. Its visual insight into the subjects' lives is similarly
nuanced, featuring different ages, stages of life, and - concurrently - health
concerns.</p><p><br/></p><p>Baths appeared frequently in works by Dürer and his
Nuremberg contemporaries. This is not very surprising, since baths were a feature
of German civic life. The earliest record of baths in Nuremberg dates back to
1288, when Konrad von Kuerenburg granted the privilege
of a bath from the river Pegnitz to the Franciscan monastery. By the sixteenth century, there were approximately
thirteen public baths spread across the city. Although it is not clear which bathhouse is represented here by Dürer, the stove in
the background and the tap close to the seated woman in the foreground make it clear that this was a technologically sophisticated bath, distinguishing it from those natural spas with which many medical writers in the sixteenth century were
preoccupied.</p><p><br/></p><p>











</p><p>It is evident from this drawing that Dürer
paid close attention to the minutiae of bathing. The bundle of twigs, which
serve as the painting's axis of perspective, were a tool for exfoliation. In the
Galenic nexus that informed the maintenance of health, baths were not simply
about washing, but about carefully managing the process of excretion that skin
enabled. For similar reasons, combing your hair (as we see the long-haired woman in
the centre doing) was an essential act of cleanliness, while protecting your
head against overexposure through the use of of hats and wraps, as worn by the three women at the front of the image, was
equally common. Finally, the younger woman bathing her elder reminds the
viewer that effective cleansing often required interpersonal attention, a facet
of which Nuremberg's civic council were well aware. From 1523, the council paid
barber-surgeons to attend to the cupping and bleeding practices demanded by this whole-scale
attention to skin. The overt sensuality and
intimacy of the drawing, as evidenced by the Peeping Tom in the corner, reminds
the viewer simultaneously of the interplay between tactility, eroticism, and health in which
skin played a crucial role.</p><p><br/></p><p>HM</p><p><br/></p><p>Image: Albrecht Dürer, Das Frauenbad, 1496, inventory number Kl 57. © Kunsthalle Bremen - Der Kunstverein in Bremen, Kupferstichkabinett</p>

                      <h3>Anna Wecker&#x27;s Cookbook</h3> <p>

<div class="page-content">
    
    
    <p><i>A Pleasing New Cookbook: of many kinds of
meals consisting of vegetables, fruit, meat, poultry, game, fish and pastries.
Not only for healthy people, but also and especially for infirm people who suffer
from various sicknesses and weaknesses, and also for pregnant women, women in
childbed and other weak people, artful and useful to be prepared</i> was published
in Amberg in 1598 and written by Anna Wecker (aka Weckerin), as this frontispiece tells us. Anna was the widow of Johann
Jacob Wecker (1528-1586), a municipal physician in Colmar and also author of several important medical treatises.</p>

<p><br/></p>

<p>Anna was not the first woman to write a
cookbook in sixteenth-century Germany. Two other notable examples include the 1545
book by Philippine Welser and the 1553 manuscript by Sabina Welser. In some
respects, it is possible to consider books such as these as a precursor to the genre popular
in seventeenth-century England that included bestsellers such as <i>The Queen's Closet Opened</i> (1655). Scholars
such as Albrecht Classen have argued that these German texts should be studied
for their insight into female creativity and literary imagination. Unlike the
Welsers, but more similar to later female authors, Anna positioned herself strategically relative to influential male physicians, including her late
husband and her son-in-law, the physician Nicholas Taurellus. Not only did she
cite the approval of her husband and the knowledge she gained from her many
years working with him, but she also claimed that he had learnt from her. For he recognised that her skills in the kitchen helped his patients recover 'almost as reliably
as a trip to the apothecary'. She wrote that when he died the physicians in
Nuremberg encouraged her to complete the project. She dedicated the text
to an important patron, the Countess of the Palatinate Louise Juliana.</p>

<p><br/></p>

<p>The significance of Anna's cookbook,
however, lies not just in the clever way in which it parlayed her medical
marriage into a place in the complex medical hierarchy; it also made a
conscious claim to extend domestic knowledge across the sphere of the
preservation of health and the curing of illness. Anna's cookbook was framed as
a text for the healthy and sick alike. As one of the
Galenic non-naturals (along with air, exercise, sleeping pattern, excretions,
and emotions), food played an important part in the maintenance of health. It
was fundamentally tied to skin, through its role in managing the porous body. Although
many physicians' books referred to diet as a key component in the maintenance of
health, they were often rather vague about precisely what you should eat or drink, preferring exhortations to moderate diets or avoiding rich food. In contrast, Anna's
book is more specific, providing great insight into what a health-conscious
mistress of an urban household might encounter on a daily basis. Its contents broke down into four major sections on nuts, fruit and vegetables, meat, and
fish, but recipes for nuts and vegetables frequently advised their use with
meat or fish. Anna's recipes incorporate a wide range of ingredients, including many spices
such as saffron, cinnamon, ginger, or turmeric, and cooking methods,
including roasting, frying, baking, and stewing. The recipes also cover modern food
categories, for example there are a variety of milk-based dishes that could be
made from almonds, rice, or other products.</p>

<p><br/></p>

<p>Anna included many recipes for 'the sick' (<i>besonders gut fur kranhkeiten</i>), while
never specifying a disease. Implicit within such recipes was often a consideration
that they might be easy to digest, with the majority of those recipes designed explicitly for
sick people relying on stewing or resulting in soft textures. In terms of the
preservation of health, Anna set great store by eggs and meat as a source of
energy. She shared a disdain for fish as a source of medical benefit with many
sixteenth-century authorities, including Erasmus, who hated fish so much that

                              <h3>Anna Wecker&#x27;s Cookbook</h3> 

<div class="page-content">
    
    
    <p><i>A Pleasing New Cookbook: of many kinds of
meals consisting of vegetables, fruit, meat, poultry, game, fish and pastries.
Not only for healthy people, but also and especially for infirm people who suffer
from various sicknesses and weaknesses, and also for pregnant women, women in
childbed and other weak people, artful and useful to be prepared</i> was published
in Amberg in 1598 and written by Anna Wecker (aka Weckerin), as this frontispiece tells us. Anna was the widow of Johann
Jacob Wecker (1528-1586), a municipal physician in Colmar and also author of several important medical treatises.</p>

<p><br/></p>

<p>Anna was not the first woman to write a
cookbook in sixteenth-century Germany. Two other notable examples include the 1545
book by Philippine Welser and the 1553 manuscript by Sabina Welser. In some
respects, it is possible to consider books such as these as a precursor to the genre popular
in seventeenth-century England that included bestsellers such as <i>The Queen's Closet Opened</i> (1655). Scholars
such as Albrecht Classen have argued that these German texts should be studied
for their insight into female creativity and literary imagination. Unlike the
Welsers, but more similar to later female authors, Anna positioned herself strategically relative to influential male physicians, including her late
husband and her son-in-law, the physician Nicholas Taurellus. Not only did she
cite the approval of her husband and the knowledge she gained from her many
years working with him, but she also claimed that he had learnt from her. For he recognised that her skills in the kitchen helped his patients recover 'almost as reliably
as a trip to the apothecary'. She wrote that when he died the physicians in
Nuremberg encouraged her to complete the project. She dedicated the text
to an important patron, the Countess of the Palatinate Louise Juliana.</p>

<p><br/></p>

<p>The significance of Anna's cookbook,
however, lies not just in the clever way in which it parlayed her medical
marriage into a place in the complex medical hierarchy; it also made a
conscious claim to extend domestic knowledge across the sphere of the
preservation of health and the curing of illness. Anna's cookbook was framed as
a text for the healthy and sick alike. As one of the
Galenic non-naturals (along with air, exercise, sleeping pattern, excretions,
and emotions), food played an important part in the maintenance of health. It
was fundamentally tied to skin, through its role in managing the porous body. Although
many physicians' books referred to diet as a key component in the maintenance of
health, they were often rather vague about precisely what you should eat or drink, preferring exhortations to moderate diets or avoiding rich food. In contrast, Anna's
book is more specific, providing great insight into what a health-conscious
mistress of an urban household might encounter on a daily basis. Its contents broke down into four major sections on nuts, fruit and vegetables, meat, and
fish, but recipes for nuts and vegetables frequently advised their use with
meat or fish. Anna's recipes incorporate a wide range of ingredients, including many spices
such as saffron, cinnamon, ginger, or turmeric, and cooking methods,
including roasting, frying, baking, and stewing. The recipes also cover modern food
categories, for example there are a variety of milk-based dishes that could be
made from almonds, rice, or other products.</p>

<p><br/></p>

<p>Anna included many recipes for 'the sick' (<i>besonders gut fur kranhkeiten</i>), while
never specifying a disease. Implicit within such recipes was often a consideration
that they might be easy to digest, with the majority of those recipes designed explicitly for
sick people relying on stewing or resulting in soft textures. In terms of the
preservation of health, Anna set great store by eggs and meat as a source of
energy. She shared a disdain for fish as a source of medical benefit with many
sixteenth-century authorities, including Erasmus, who hated fish so much that
he finagled a lifetime dispensation to eat meat on fast days! Overall,
however, she placed particular emphasis on a woman upholding her individual discernment when using cooking to dispense medical help. She wrote that her recipes
were not simply to be copied, but to be adapted depending on a patient's
nature, age, physical constitution, habits, geographical location, and the
context of their disease. The degree to which Anna expected her female audience
to be aware of and interpret for themselves the cornerstones of the Galenic,
humoral body attests to a high level of medical literacy in early modern
Germany and an expansive idea of the domesticity of health and its management.</p><p><br/></p><p>HM</p><p><br/></p><p>Image © Bayerische

    <p>The first printed treatise to mention the practice of acupuncture was <i>De Medicina Indorum</i> by Jacobus Bontius (1592-1631), which appeared after his death in 1642 (see image). Bontius praised acupuncture, which he called the art of the 'stylus argenteus' for its ability to produce cures that were more effective than miracles, but he did not address its purpose. In <i>Dissertatio de Arthridite; Mantisse Schematica; De Acupunctura; et Orationes Tres</i> (1683), Willem ten Rhijne, a physician with the Dutch East India Company, presented the most systematic and informative European account of the practice. Ten Rhijne was aware that acupuncture was used to treat pain, but he was more attentive to the techniques used to puncture the skin (such as whether the needle was inserted by twisting or tapping) than he was to the medical system underlying it. He was detailed in his account when describing the materials from which the needles were made, comparing them favourably to the unrefined steel of 'barbarous European surgeons', but he translated <i>Qi </i> - what we might think of today as 'energy flows' - as 'breath' (<i>flatus</i>, <i>spiritus</i>) and so hypothesised that needling was intended to relieve excessive air. Engelbert Kaempfer's important study of Chinese medicine devotes a chapter to acupuncture, but in his more widely read <i>History of Japan</i> Kaempfer suggests that the Japanese surgeons who questioned Jesuit priests about medical practices were themselves more interested in blood-letting than in <i>Qi</i> points.</p><p><br/></p><p>The interests of the surgeons in Kaempfer's account, however misrepresented, remind us nonetheless that while western authors devoted themselves to commentary that often undermined the theories of eastern physicians, the practice of acupuncture was itself the subject of great debate in China and Japan. The spread of epidemics in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries meant that fever was a concern within Chinese medicine, ushering in new emphases on botany, pharmacology, and physiology. In this changing climate, the traditional place of acupuncture was highly contested. During the eighteenth century, a general shift to differentiate learned medicine saw prominent physicians abandon the art of acupuncture and, in 1822, the practice was banned by an imperial edict and removed from the medical curriculum.</p><p><br/></p><p>HM</p><p><br/></p><p>Main image: Acupuncture needles, China, 1700-1901 by Science Museum, London.

                      <h3>Cheese and Skin</h3> <p>

<div class="page-content">
    
    
    <p>At
first glance, Aristotle and Renaissance cheesemakers have very little in common.
Yet Renaissance physicians thought otherwise. For according to them, cheesemakers and Aristotle shared a
certain knowledge of the surface (or skin) of bodies - human bodies and
coagulated milk. In 1477, the Italian physician and diplomat
Pantaleone da Confienza published <i>Summa Lacticiniorum</i>, the first treatise on milk and
dairy products. This monograph drew clear comparisons between Aristotle's knowledge and that of artisan cheesemakers, who were mostly women - a fact reflected in this image of a fresco at Buonconsiglio Castle in Trento, Italy.</p><p><br/></p><p>Aristotle used cheese as an analogy, with this dairy substance becoming an explanatory
tool in different parts of his work, and for different purposes. The process of
coagulation of milk through the action of rennet (which came mostly from the stomachs of sheep and goats) was useful for illustrating the process of generation
of a foetus <i>in utero</i>:</p><p></p><ul><li>the rennet on milk acted just as active male semen on passive
menstrual blood in order to create and shape human life (<i>Generation of Animals</i>, I, xx);<br/></li><li>the formation
of human skin as a crust made of dried flesh which captured the vapours of
foetal concoction inside the body was similar to how rind on cheese is formed (<i>Generation of Animals</i>, II, vi);<br/></li><li>the
processes of transformation of natural matter through the action of hot and
cold elements (<i>Meteorology</i>, book IV);<br/></li><li>and finally, the process through which worms and insects could be generated spontaneously from rotten matter (<i>History of
Animals</i>, V, xxxi).<br/></li></ul><p></p><p>The cosmological connections between generation,
putrefaction, skin, and cheese are many, and indeed predate Aristotle. We only have to recall the myth surrounding the invention of cheese, a tale widespread
in cultures of south-west Asia. It tells the story of a nomadic traveller who filled his bags, which were made from the stomachs of animals, with milk at the onset of a long journey, only to find it coagulated when he had reached his destination. Or we can turn to the famous Menocchio, the
protagonist of Carlo Ginzburg’s <i>The
Cheese and the Worms</i>, who built a materialistic pagan cosmology based on
the belief in spontaneous generation out of rotten cheese.</p><p><br/></p><p>But it was Pantaleone writing in the late 15<sup>th</sup> century who drew more specific links between cheesemakers and Aristotle, evident in the passages that describe his
travels through Western Europe while seeking new observations on cheesemaking. In fact, he recalled all the relevant Aristotelian passages,
particularly those that drew an analogy between human skin and cheese rind. He referenced these important natural philosophical principles by referring to the
actions of the hands of these illiterate cheesemakers. Those artisans 'stored
cheeses in chilly and lightened places, with ample windows for the circulation
of the air, on clean shelves, smoothing them down with their hands'. Pantaleone
remarked that if one were to ask these artisans why they preserve the cheese in the way
they do, 'they would reply that they don’t know the reason', since many of
them 'simply follow habit and tradition'. This learned physician was fascinated
by the artisanal skills, mainly non-verbal, of the cheesemakers. For, though presumably ignorant of Aristotle’s natural philosophy and Galen’s theory of complexions, they seemed more well informed than others of how to stimulate and encourage natural processes of transformation.</p><p><br/></p><p>It is significant that Pantaleone often refers to these artisans as <i>magistri</i> and <i>doctores</i>,<i> </i>using such terms to reflect their learned status in their art of creating smooth surfaces from the fermentation and coagulation of matter.</p><p><br/></p><p>PS</p><p><br/></p><p>Further Reading:</p><p></p><ul><li>Paul

cold elements (<i>Meteorology</i>, book IV);<br/></li><li>and finally, the process through which worms and insects could be generated spontaneously from rotten matter (<i>History of
Animals</i>, V, xxxi).<br/></li></ul><p></p><p>The cosmological connections between generation,
putrefaction, skin, and cheese are many, and indeed predate Aristotle. We only have to recall the myth surrounding the invention of cheese, a tale widespread
in cultures of south-west Asia. It tells the story of a nomadic traveller who filled his bags, which were made from the stomachs of animals, with milk at the onset of a long journey, only to find it coagulated when he had reached his destination. Or we can turn to the famous Menocchio, the
protagonist of Carlo Ginzburg’s <i>The
Cheese and the Worms</i>, who built a materialistic pagan cosmology based on
the belief in spontaneous generation out of rotten cheese.</p><p><br/></p><p>But it was Pantaleone writing in the late 15<sup>th</sup> century who drew more specific links between cheesemakers and Aristotle, evident in the passages that describe his
travels through Western Europe while seeking new observations on cheesemaking. In fact, he recalled all the relevant Aristotelian passages,
particularly those that drew an analogy between human skin and cheese rind. He referenced these important natural philosophical principles by referring to the
actions of the hands of these illiterate cheesemakers. Those artisans 'stored
cheeses in chilly and lightened places, with ample windows for the circulation
of the air, on clean shelves, smoothing them down with their hands'. Pantaleone
remarked that if one were to ask these artisans why they preserve the cheese in the way
they do, 'they would reply that they don’t know the reason', since many of
them 'simply follow habit and tradition'. This learned physician was fascinated
by the artisanal skills, mainly non-verbal, of the cheesemakers. For, though presumably ignorant of Aristotle’s natural philosophy and Galen’s theory of complexions, they seemed more well informed than others of how to stimulate and encourage natural processes of transformation.</p><p><br/></p><p>It is significant that Pantaleone often refers to these artisans as <i>magistri</i> and <i>doctores</i>,<i> </i>using such terms to reflect their learned status in their art of creating smooth surfaces from the fermentation and coagulation of matter.</p><p><br/></p><p>PS</p><p><br/></p><p>Further Reading:</p><p></p><ul><li>Paul

                      <h3>Ironing out Wrinkles</h3> <p>

<div class="page-content">
    
    
    <p>Despite a plethora of early modern recipes for
beautifying the skin, wrinkles as a skin concern are rarely addressed directly in these. Out of more than 200 recipes for beautifying skin within the 1561 work <i>I secreti della signora Isabella
Cortese</i> (<i>The Secrets of the Lady Isabella Cortese</i>), there is just one
that refers to wrinkles, which features in a section on cosmetic waters. It is a
water to make the face beautiful 'without wrinkles' (Ch. 89: <i>Acqua da uiso
che’l fa bello senza rughe</i>). There is also a recipe for an oil to preserve
youthfulness (Ch. 56: <i>Olio per conseruar la giouentu</i>), which may have been intended to treat wrinkles along with other effects of old age. It is possible that many of Cortese's other recipes do also refer to treating wrinkles, though indirectly, with references to smoothing the skin or making it more lustrous. The ideal skin should be polished, freckle- and spot-free, and pale. A modicum of rosiness was desirable in the cheeks, as it alluded to an ideal sanguine complexion, although redness in the face was detrimental and
the subject of many recipes. There are the many vague recipes to ‘make the face
beautiful’. These equally might concern wrinkly skin. Similarly, <i>Gli Experimenti
</i>of Caterina Sforza (1463-1509) is awash with recipes to make oneself
beautiful (<i>A far bella</i>) and remedy issues such as freckles, spots, and
redness. However, wrinkles are not mentioned by name. A century and a
half later, Thomas Jeamson’s <i>Artificiall Embellishments or Arts Best
Directions. How to Preserve Beauty or Procure It </i>(1665) also covered
the same concerns, but again does not mention wrinkles explicitly.</p><p><br/></p>

<p>The reason for this seeming omission is actually rather simple. Wrinkles brought on by old age
were a natural phenomenon, caused by the body's moisture drying out. Thus, it was seen as ‘incurable’. Each person (male or female) was born with a certain quantity of innate
moisture, termed ‘radical moisture’. Over time, this dried out slowly with the body's heat. This concept, introduced by Galen and later expanded
further by medieval Arabic scholars, was illustrated by a metaphorical oil
lamp. The oily wick, symbolising the radical moisture, is consumed by
the flame. In alchemy, the quintessence was the radical moisture of metals, and
its creation and consumption by an alchemist could delay or even remove the
marks of old age. Erasmus comments on this in his 1518 work <i>Oration in Praise of the Art of
Medicine</i> (<i>Declamatio in laudem artis medicinae</i>): 'for it is not a
fable, but rather attested by a number of witnesses that by means of the fifth
essence man can shed decrepitude like a snakeskin and rejuvenate himself'.</p><p><br/></p>

<p>Wrinkles of old age could not be cured with the
ointments or waters found in beauty recipes. The only wrinkles that could be treated
were premature ones, quite unconnected to the ageing process. In his chapter on
wrinkles (<i>de rugis</i>) <a href="../defining/mercuriale-and-skin/index.html">Girolamo Mercuriale</a> (see <i>De decoratione,</i> 1585, ch. 23) commented that 'regarding the wrinkles that occur on
account of age, people may be able to sometimes hide them by painting them but
they cannot be cured. However when wrinkles are caused by other causes of
disease, they can receive treatment'. For Mercuriale, wrinkles that could be
treated were those caused by disease and fever, as well as those on the bodies of fat
people who had slimmed down (he also includes here the wombs of women who had given
birth frequently). Similarly in Giambattista della Porta’s 1558 <i>Magia Naturalis</i> (<i>Natural
Magic</i>), many of the recipes refer to wrinkles on the belly or breasts
after childbearing, or those caused by the sun. He does nevertheless include three
recipes for 'a wrinkled face'.</p><p><br/></p>

<p>In <i>De decoratione</i>, Mercuriale noted that one of the
causes of premature wrinkles on the hands and faces of women was due to them
washing with warm rather than cold water. Wrinkles could be spotted by their
roughness and unevenness, which was due to the ‘fleshy material’ under the skin drying up
and thus ‘melting’ away, leaving the loose folds of skin. Mercuriale advised
making sure that the skin was stretched in an even manner to avoid premature
wrinkles. This could be achieved by rubbing the skin with either sweet oil or
goose or chicken fat mixed with a bit of red lead oxide. He also remarked without
further comment that some people used human fat for this purpose. </p>

<p><br/></p><p>To disguise wrinkles, Mercuriale proposed three anti-wrinkle medicines (<i>medicamentum derugatorium</i>). He claimed that these were better than alchemical remedies, such as ‘sublimated silver water’, which were harmful to one's health although popular with 'many women'. The first
two of Mercuriale's medicines came with a certain pedigree in their authorship. The remedy from Paul of Aegina (AD 7) involved mixing figs with bryony, vetch flour, and honey. It was noted that even
rubbing vetch flour alone on the face was helpful, adding that a mixture of only honey and vinegar placed in an alembic also did a marvellous job in
hiding facial wrinkles. The second remedy came from Galen. This consisted of mixing together terebinth, litharge, and white olive oil (derived from immature olives). The third medicine was a contemporary recipe, one which 'women are in the habit of obtaining,
requesting frequently from doctors'. It involved boiling the roots of sea holly
in rainwater and adding chalk made from egg shells.  This decoction would
then be applied to the face and hands. The chalk alone could be mixed with vinegar
and rubbed on the face to achieve the desired effect. In addition, a mixture of cuttlefish bone dust
and runny honey or paste made from the ashes of a burnt ox horn with vinegar could also be smeared
on the face - though you would have to lie down for a bit for this last recipe.</p><p><br/></p><p>All these recipes could only delay the onset of wrinkles or help hide
premature ones. Wrinkles from old age were insurmountable!</p><p><br/></p><p>KWM</p><p><br/></p>

<div class="page-content">
    
    
    <p>A blend of humanism, love for classical sources, observation, and
experimentation brought about rather peculiar outcomes in the early modern period. One particular example is a description of fish-hunting offered by both Giovanni Battista Della
Porta and Ulisse Aldrovandi. These authors relied on <i>Halieutica</i>, a 2nd-century work on fishing by the Greek poet Oppian, which was published together with a Latin translation in 1517 by the famous Venetian printer Aldus Manutius.</p><p><br/></p><p>Della Porta wrote one of the most important
scientific bestsellers of the early modern period, <i>Magia naturalis</i>, published first in Latin in 1558 and then later as a new, and much
expanded, edition in 1589. The book was translated into Italian, French, Dutch,
German, and English, and by the middle of the 17<sup>th</sup> century more than
50 editions of the work had been published. According to Della Porta, natural magic was based on the observation of the mechanics of nature and an
imitation of this.</p>
    
    
    
    <div class="default">
    <blockquote>
        &#x27;It appears to us that Magic is nothing else than a kind of contemplation of nature. The reason is that by examining the motions and trasmutations of the heavens, the stars, the elements, as well as of the animals, plants, minerals, their births and deaths, in this way one can discover the hidden secrets which our science uncovers from the face of nature.&#x27;

    <p>Ulisse Aldrovandi is one of the most famous naturalists of the early modern period. He was also a collector and author of a significant number of manuscripts, which were mostly published posthumously. Among his writings, he wrote a large volume on fishes, <i>De piscibus</i> (1613). It is typical of late Renaissance natural history, listing for every fish included mythological and literary sources, its habits, the food it consumed, the places in which it could be found, and the ways in which to catch it.</p><p><br/></p><p>It seems then that natural magic and natural history were genres in which discussions to catch fish figured prominently. The technique for fishing sea bream (<i>sargus</i> or <i>sargo</i>) involved this fish’s love for goats, suggesting that fishermen might dress in goat skin. And we read in the words of Della Porta the following:</p><p><br/></p><p>'Sea breams are in love with goats, so much so than when goats go by the sea they, or they see the shadow of a goat appearing on the water, they run and begin to happily jump above the water, taken by a burning desire to get close to them … Fishermen dresse themselves with goat skin, put the goat’s horns on their head, and thus dressed wait for the sea bream; the fishes run around him, and at that point he throws in the water the skin: the sea breams will swim around the skin and it will be easy for the fisherman to catch them.'<br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Without specifying whether they observed this technique or not, when it came to sea bream the naturalist and the magician were on the same page.</p><p><br/></p><p>PS</p><p><br/></p><p>Further Reading:</p><p></p><ul><li><p>Paula Findlen, <i>Possessing Nature: Museums, Collecting, and Scientific Culture in Early Modern Italy </i>(Berkeley, 1994)</p></li><li><p>William Eamon, <i>Science and the </i><i>Secrets of Nature: Books of Secrets in Medieval and Early Modern Culture</i> (Princeton, N.J., 1994)</p></li></ul><p></p><p><br/></p><p>Image of a Sea Bream copied from Conrad Gessner and published in Ulisse Aldrovandi, <i>De piscibus</i> (Bologna, 1613)</p>

experimentation brought about rather peculiar outcomes in the early modern period. One particular example is a description of fish-hunting offered by both Giovanni Battista Della
Porta and Ulisse Aldrovandi. These authors relied on <i>Halieutica</i>, a 2nd-century work on fishing by the Greek poet Oppian, which was published together with a Latin translation in 1517 by the famous Venetian printer Aldus Manutius.</p><p><br/></p><p>Della Porta wrote one of the most important
scientific bestsellers of the early modern period, <i>Magia naturalis</i>, published first in Latin in 1558 and then later as a new, and much
expanded, edition in 1589. The book was translated into Italian, French, Dutch,
German, and English, and by the middle of the 17<sup>th</sup> century more than
50 editions of the work had been published. According to Della Porta, natural magic was based on the observation of the mechanics of nature and an
imitation of this.</p>

        &#x27;It appears to us that Magic is nothing else than a kind of contemplation of nature. The reason is that by examining the motions and trasmutations of the heavens, the stars, the elements, as well as of the animals, plants, minerals, their births and deaths, in this way one can discover the hidden secrets which our science uncovers from the face of nature.&#x27;

    <p>Ulisse Aldrovandi is one of the most famous naturalists of the early modern period. He was also a collector and author of a significant number of manuscripts, which were mostly published posthumously. Among his writings, he wrote a large volume on fishes, <i>De piscibus</i> (1613). It is typical of late Renaissance natural history, listing for every fish included mythological and literary sources, its habits, the food it consumed, the places in which it could be found, and the ways in which to catch it.</p><p><br/></p><p>It seems then that natural magic and natural history were genres in which discussions to catch fish figured prominently. The technique for fishing sea bream (<i>sargus</i> or <i>sargo</i>) involved this fish’s love for goats, suggesting that fishermen might dress in goat skin. And we read in the words of Della Porta the following:</p><p><br/></p><p>'Sea breams are in love with goats, so much so than when goats go by the sea they, or they see the shadow of a goat appearing on the water, they run and begin to happily jump above the water, taken by a burning desire to get close to them … Fishermen dresse themselves with goat skin, put the goat’s horns on their head, and thus dressed wait for the sea bream; the fishes run around him, and at that point he throws in the water the skin: the sea breams will swim around the skin and it will be easy for the fisherman to catch them.'<br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Without specifying whether they observed this technique or not, when it came to sea bream the naturalist and the magician were on the same page.</p><p><br/></p><p>PS</p><p><br/></p><p>Further Reading:</p><p></p><ul><li><p>Paula Findlen, <i>Possessing Nature: Museums, Collecting, and Scientific Culture in Early Modern Italy </i>(Berkeley, 1994)</p></li><li><p>William Eamon, <i>Science and the </i><i>Secrets of Nature: Books of Secrets in Medieval and Early Modern Culture</i> (Princeton, N.J., 1994)</p></li></ul><p></p><p><br/></p><p>Image of a Sea Bream copied from Conrad Gessner and published in Ulisse Aldrovandi, <i>De piscibus</i> (Bologna, 1613)</p>

                      <h3>The Anatomy of Resurrection</h3> <p>

<div class="page-content">
    
    
    <p>This well-known illustration from Jacopo Berengario da
Carpi’s 1522 anatomy handbook is meant to show the structure and location of the muscles within the abdomen and chest, but it undoubtedly achieves much more than
this. The male figure is captured in the moment of having just lifted up his skin, willingly offering the viewer the chance to observe his
internal layers. At the same time, a religious
dimension pervades the image: ideas of sanctity and martyrdom are conveyed by
this self-displaying man encircled by a radial ornament. In the 16th century, it was usually the
bodies of executed criminals that were dissected publicly for the benefit of medical students and
other onlookers. This picture seems to tell us
that prior to execution and dissection, the condemned individual had
been illuminated by the spiritual light of consolation after having
experienced a conversion. The rays of light are almost like a prolongation of
his earthly body into a heavenly one. What appears to be a tear upon his cheek is suggestive of this man scarifying himself - a martyr for knowledge of the human body.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The literary genre of the <i>ars moriendi</i> (the art of dying) flourished in late
medieval Europe. Handbooks containing instructions for the preparation of a
good and Christian death became widespread in urban centres. In the same
period, the benefits of confession and absolution were extended also to those criminals
condemned to execution. This new concern was reflected by the early 14th century in turn through the
foundation of confraternities devoted to
ensuring a good death for criminals. In northern Europe these activities
were administered by clerics. In Italy, the confraternities were formed of laymen who gave
themselves the task of assisting with the religious care of the condemned until the
very moment they were sent to the scaffold. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>These Italian brotherhoods of comforters, as they were known, were responsible for both the comforting of the condemned until the very point of execution and
for the dramatic representations of religious events, in particular the Passion
and the Resurrection of Christ. Audiences of the faithful flocked to outdoor
stages on religious feast days to see dramatisations on the themes of death and
martyrdom. A few days later they might have returned to the same place to witness
the rituals that accompanied a prisoner’s final hours. </p>

<p> </p>

Comforters’ manuals were explicit in advising the comforter to ensure that the condemned considered himself martyr and, as such, should behave in an appropriate way. In addition to singing songs and offering prayers, the comforters presented those who were due to be executed with a small tablet (<i>tavoletta</i>). These little plaques often depicted the instruments of the Passion, the Crucifixion
of Christ, or the martyrdom of a saint. The comforter's role was to keep these <i>tavolette </i>as close to the face of the condemned as possible, in order to keep his
attention fixed on the image while he was on public display. This enabled his mind to remain focused on the virtuous and comforting examples of Christ and other martyrs in the midst of unfriendly shouts and insults being hurled by the public before his execution.

                      <h3>My Lovely Horse</h3> <p>

<div class="page-content">
    
    
    <p>In line with Galenic principles, the colour of a horse was ascribed to its humoral temperament. The humoral
mix affected not only a horse's skin but also its disposition.</p>

<p><br/></p>

<p>A horse dominated by yellow bile
(choleric) with a hot and dry complexion would be a chestnut colour and, by nature, light and fiery but lacking in force. If phlegmatic with a cold
and damp complexion, the horse would be white, often accompanied by a rather a
dull and slow outlook. An abundance of black bile signified a melancholic animal with
a cold and dry complexion, it would be sad and faint-hearted, coloured dun or black. And finally, if the predominant humour was blood with a
warm and damp complexion, the colour of the horse would be bay (brown with a black mane
and tail). This sanguine complexion (manifested as bay in horses and as pale skin with rosy cheeks
in humans) was the most prized, and such horses were judged to have a steady
and pleasant disposition combined with loyalty and taking easy to the rein.</p>

<p><br/></p>

<p>This was the basic premise but the relationship
between humoral mixture and skin colour could be developed even further. For
example, in 1602 Pirro Antonio Ferraro suggested that the dappled grey (<i>leardo chiaro</i>) was caused by an even humoral mixture of blood
and phlegm and indicated an animal of great vigour and long life, while a dun
horse (<i>falbo</i>) was a mix of yellow and
black bile, both choleric and melancholic.</p>

<p><br/></p>

<p>It was not only skin colour that reflected temperament. Markings on the horse such
as stripes, socks, or stockings could also indicate either positive or
negative characteristics in an animal’s deportment. For example, a completely black
horse (by nature melancholic) with no markings whatsoever was a complete
liability for its owner, as 'it is marvel if he drowne him not, or hurt him by
some other way' (Leonard Mascall, 1587). Nevertheless the same author believed that if a
black horse had a white spot on his forehead, a white stripe on his nose, or
a white sock or stocking on one of the back legs 'he likely to doe wel'. While
skin colour due to humoral balances was the accepted norm in judging a horse,
not all authors were convinced that markings were so essential:</p>
    
    
    
    <div class="default">
    <blockquote>
        &#x27;sure I am that neither with foot, white star, white list, strake, snip, phillet in the forehead, white rump, black and red flea-bytings, ostrick-feather, where it cannot be seen, meal-nose, meale-slank, bearded under his chops like a Goat, black and long fetterlocks, long main, black tail, black list, and such like, are not to be depended on as the assurant of a good Horse, for undoubtedly you shall find good and bad of all colours, but to overcome Custom, is a hard fight&#x27;

    </blockquote>
</div>
    
    
    
    <p>White markings could be 'created' on a horse’s hide, and various recipes in equine treatises attest to this practice. In his 1591 work, Filippo Scaccho da Tagliacozzo recommended to use a razor to shave off the black or red hairs from the place that you wished to make white before then applying to the area a pounded paste of the roots of a squirting cucumber, nitre, and honey. The most sought-after marking was a white star on a horse’s forehead, as this could increase the animal's value substantially. In his treatise <i>Markhams faithfull farrier </i>(1630), Gervase Markham advocated a popular recipe for this that involved roasting sour apples, which were then peeled and applied to the horse’s forehead until the fruit cooled. If dark hairs remained, another hot apple could be applied. The blistered skin would then be treated with honey until it healed.</p><p><br/></p><p>In addition to skin colour and markings, an early modern horse could also be judged on other marks of outward appearance, such as the shape of its back, barrel, rump, or legs. Equine treatises were able to offer advice if a horse’s overall shape needed to be improved due to it being too fat or too thin. Mascall suggested feeding a horse barley or wheat that had been soaked in water until it was of a porridge-like consistency 'to plump or puffe up a leane Horse, in short time', while a 'verie fatte' horse was to be given bran mixed with honey and warm water. Thus, in the early modern period a perfectly lovely horse could be achieved by a combination of both nature and human assistance!</p><p><br/></p><p>Further Reading:</p><p></p><ul><li>Martin Arredondo, <i>Prima, segunda, y tercera parte Obras de Albeyteria </i>(1669, multiple editions)<br/></li><li>Pirro Antonio Ferraro, <i>Cavallo Frenato</i> (Naples, 1602) <br/></li><li>Gervase Markham, <i>Markhams faithfull farrier </i>(London, 1630)<br/></li><li>Leonard Mascall, <i>The first booke of cattell </i>(London, 1587)<br/></li><li>Filippo Scaccho da Tagliacozzo, <i>Opera di Mescalzia</i> (Rome, 1591)<br/></li><li>Wellcome Library, Ms 7023 (Equine Management, Italy 17th century)<br/></li></ul><p></p><p>Image: Tin-glazed earthenware dish, Deruta (c. 1520-50).

In his 1591 work, Filippo Scaccho da Tagliacozzo recommended to use a razor to shave off the black or red hairs from the place that you wished to make white before then applying to the area a pounded paste of the roots of a squirting cucumber, nitre, and honey. The most sought-after marking was a white star on a horse’s forehead, as this could increase the animal's value substantially. In his treatise <i>Markhams faithfull farrier </i>(1630), Gervase Markham advocated a popular recipe for this that involved roasting sour apples, which were then peeled and applied to the horse’s forehead until the fruit cooled. If dark hairs remained, another hot apple could be applied. The blistered skin would then be treated with honey until it healed.</p><p><br/></p><p>In addition to skin colour and markings, an early modern horse could also be judged on other marks of outward appearance, such as the shape of its back, barrel, rump, or legs. Equine treatises were able to offer advice if a horse’s overall shape needed to be improved due to it being too fat or too thin. Mascall suggested feeding a horse barley or wheat that had been soaked in water until it was of a porridge-like consistency 'to plump or puffe up a leane Horse, in short time', while a 'verie fatte' horse was to be given bran mixed with honey and warm water. Thus, in the early modern period a perfectly lovely horse could be achieved by a combination of both nature and human assistance!</p><p><br/></p><p>Further Reading:</p><p></p><ul><li>Martin Arredondo, <i>Prima, segunda, y tercera parte Obras de Albeyteria </i>(1669, multiple editions)<br/></li><li>Pirro Antonio Ferraro, <i>Cavallo Frenato</i> (Naples, 1602) <br/></li><li>Gervase Markham, <i>Markhams faithfull farrier </i>(London, 1630)<br/></li><li>Leonard Mascall, <i>The first booke of cattell </i>(London, 1587)<br/></li><li>Filippo Scaccho da Tagliacozzo, <i>Opera di Mescalzia</i> (Rome, 1591)<br/></li><li>Wellcome Library, Ms 7023 (Equine Management, Italy 17th century)<br/></li></ul><p></p><p>Image: Tin-glazed earthenware dish, Deruta (c. 1520-50).

                      <h3>Citrusmania!</h3> <p>

<div class="page-content">
    
    
    <p>Visual and written descriptions of citrus fruits – along
with a widespread desire for them – peaked between the late sixteenth and the first half of the seventeenth centuries in early modern Europe. The virtues and appearance of citrus fruits were praised in a range of sources from paintings and natural history treatises, to botanical repertoires and farming and
gardening manuals, just to name a few. Citrus fruits - oranges, lemons, and citrons - were part of the tradition of medieval dietetics, a branch of medicine classifying vegetal and animal products according to
their humoral complexion. By the middle of the seventeenth century, some
books counted as many as 80 varieties of citrus fruit and described their surfaces meticulously, often employing the same Latin term used for skin, <i>cutis</i>.</p>

<p><br/></p>

<p>The first monograph, albeit short, on citrus fruits to break away from a traditional association with medical
dietetics was written by Nicolas Monardes and published in Antwerp in 1564. Monardes was a physician
from Seville who had travelled in the New World, publishing a famous account
of the flora and fauna of the Indies. <i>De malis citriis, aurantiis, ac limoniis libelli</i> is not illustrated but it
emphasises the artificial origins of the varieties of citrus that were, in essence, cultivated by humans
through experimentations with grafting.  The multiple editions
of Pietro Andrea Mattioli’s famous commentary to the Greek botanist Dioscorides contained detailed
illustrations of citrus fruits, with considerable attention paid to their
surfaces. Writing on the so-called 'Adam’s apples' (<i>pomi
d’Adamo</i>), Mattioli explained how 'Their peel (<i>scorza</i>)
is wrinkled, irregular, and has certain small fissures, as it if had bitten by
the teeth; and that is where they got their name from, because the people
believe that these were the fruits Adam did bite in the garden of Eden. But
those are all fables.' (<i>I discorsi di Pietro
Andrea Mattioli</i>, Venice, 1568, p. 270) (see main image).</p>

In the same period, the famous northern Italian agronomist Agostino Gallo devoted an entire section of his treatise on farming to citrus gardens, praising their commercial value. From his description, it clearly emerges that citrus fruits were also shown off on the table for their aesthetic qualities.</p><p></p><p></p>

        &#x27;Gardeners make money out of the mature fruits, both the small ones and the beautiful ones.

And everybody knows how the ripe and beautiful citruses are in demand for banquets, for candying, and as food for the sick, for the preparation of medicaments, as all the experienced apothecaries know. From the peel (scorza) of the oranges one can make money, as they are used to make mustard and spiced bread, and citruses are sold to make citrus confetti. Gardeners can even make money from the rotten fruits, as they can be used to squeeze the juice or to take out the seeds […]. If the cost is constant, so is the income.&#x27;

    <p>But the most lavishly illustrated treatise on citrus fruits was written by the Jesuit Giovanni Battista Ferrari, the <i>Hesperides sive de malorum Aureorum cultura et usu </i>published in Rome in 1646. Ferrari was a professor of Hebrew at the Roman College and, after the election of pope Urban VIII in 1623, he became a gardener (though more like a 'horticultural adviser') for the Barberini family. He took full advantage of the documents gathered by Cassiano dal Pozzo, an eclectic collector and natural historian, and eminent member of the Academy of the Linceans. Dal Pozzo had brought together information on citrus trees and fruits from gardeners working all over Europe, but in particular from the Italian regions of Campania and Liguria. Dal Pozzo passed on all these documents to Ferrari to assist him in drafting his treatise. Ferrari's book combines naturalistic descriptions, gardening techniques, and mythological accounts of the origins of citrus fruits alongside illustrations by the likes of Domenichino, Reni, Poussin, Romanelli, and Pietro da Cortona, but to name a few. The majority of the 80 illustrations, of which 50 or so show hybrids and the teratological transformations of citrus fruits, are by the Dutch engraver Cornelis Bloemaert. Some of them were produced with the aid of a microscope. As David Freedberg notes, 'never had the surfaces of their [citrus fruits] peel been shown with such obsessive attention to every kind of texture, rugosity, lump, and protuberance' (see figure).<br/></p><p><br/></p><p>This is an example of one of the many varieties of lemons as described by Ferrari. Of note is the language employed, as it seems as if Ferrari was describing human skin.</p>

        &#x27;The Etruscan land of Pietrasanta, close to Liguria, generates with the name of citron-lemon (Limon citratus) the most pleasant and sweet of the lemons, born out of grafting a citrus, which is called citron-lemon because of its color and perfume. In Florence, mother of all lemons, grows the best quality of them, with a double name. The first kind is called smooth, because it is less rough; the other kind is called rough, because of its prominent lumps, or broncone because it is rough as the trunk of a tree […] Often it takes a oblong and somehow swelling shape, then it gets thinner and pointed in the upper part […] The skin (cutis) is golden when the fruit is ripe, soft and light, full of cavities (verruculis) on the upper end, mostly hispid, wrinkled (rugis caperata), and sweet around the perfumed upper end, therefore it is good to eat. The pulp (carnosa pars) is almost two fingers deep, and very soft and sweet to the palate: the part covered with 10 to 12 membranes is juicy and a little acidulous. It contains around 20 seeds.&#x27;

    <p>In any case, the Jesuit was not born in a void. Citrus fruits were used and described for commercial, aesthetic, medical, naturalistic, and technical (the juice was used in the processes of chemical tincture) reasons. The emphasis on the peel, skin, and surface is connected to a contemporary emphasis of genres such as <i>historiae</i>, <i>observationes</i>, and <i>descriptiones</i> in the natural sciences. Such approaches brought attention to the external appearance of these natural objects and, in turn, were influenced by commercial and technical descriptions of the integrity and peculiarities of such surfaces.</p>

                      <h3>16th-Century Tunisian Material Culture Through the Eyes of An Italian Knight</h3> <p>

<div class="page-content">
    
    
    <p>In 1574, large parts of modern-day Tunisia, including
the cities of Tunis and Bizerte, were conquered by the Ottoman Empire. This followed a
long war with the Spanish army and its allies. Miguel de
Cervantes, among others, participated in the war. In the Biblioteca
Universitaria di Bologna (BUB) is an interesting document that was written
by one of the minor military leaders from the Spanish army. The author is the Italian 'Don
Giuseppe Terla, knight of Saint Mauritius and Jerusalemite knight, for Marcello
Melchiorre' and he was one of the leaders at the Battle of Bizerte. Among the military details, his account includes descriptions of everyday life of the
Tunisian people. We read about such things as their food, the ways in which they rode horses, and their leather garments. Despite a contempt for their religious beliefs, these descriptions reflect a curious interest from the Westerners of 'Arabic' material culture and their passion
for the costumes of different peoples. Here follow some excerpts.</p><p></p>
    
    
    
    <div class="default">
    <blockquote>
        [344r] In that country, horses are almost always unshoed, and the majority of men riding them go around half-naked, only with large-sized trousers and a big turban on the head […] Many of the inhabitants are Arabs, [346r] who ride their horses bridleless and with no saddle, carrying long spears or small blades to throw; these are called &#x27;ferres&#x27; which means ‘rider’ in our language, because they ride horses; the difference is that noble riders are simply called Arab knights, and the other riders. Arabs are incredibly wealthy, and many of them own 300, 400 and even 1500 camels, which they use to carry their possessions around, to work the land in their farms, and to eat (especially dried and salted, as we do with pigs); and I believe they make butter with it, as we [346v] do with cows. They hold their false religion in great esteem, and they are superstitious about all things; they wear little books and writings bound in leather, velvet, and silk around their neck, as we do with the Agnus Dei: some people wear four of them, some six, according to their taste, and they hang strings of them around their horses’ heads when they fight, as they believe in this way they are protected from all kinds of dangers. They are circumcised and they belong to the Mohameddan sect, but nonetheless they are fierce enemies of the Turks and they hate them for the tyranny they impose upon them. They don’t play games like Christians, and they never curse. They honour their churches [347r], called Mosques: they draw beautiful histories on their floors, they only access them without shoes, and once they get in, they form a row and they sing Alà Alà while some priests read stories from the Old Testament, in the version that appears in their own books, of which they have many. […] They sleep on certain [347v] skins of sheep and mutton. Some nobles have beds in their rooms, which are long and narrow, and such beds have heads taller than a man. Beds are embedded in the wall, and they are beautiful, Moorish-style, with wonderful engravings, and they use little stairs to climb up such beds and go to sleep. Some have wool mattresses and beautiful cotton blankets, and silk coloured cloths. Women never see men during daytime, but they sleep together at night. Noblemen have glass mirrors embedded in the walls of their houses, painted with some Moorish-style themes. They are jealous and shy, and some have slaves, both Christians and of their own sects, which they trade [348r] for money. They are very good at farming […] and they share many other pastimes with us, such as playing cards, dicing, etc.

<div class="page-content">
    
    
    <p>Late
sixteenth and early seventeenth-century noble families in Italy loved to spend
time at their country villas. A new vogue for husbandry, the simple life and
the fresh air of the countryside took root among the patrician classes.
Noblemen and women were eager to spend time away from their political duties
and from the dangerous miasmas prevalent in the urban environment, where plague
remained a significant threat. While in the country, they enjoyed the pleasures
of farming, gardening, hunting, and appreciation of animals - especially
horses. This change from town to country life encouraged the development of
expertise in livestock and animal husbandry.</p>

<p><br/></p><p>The
powerful Gozzadini family, famously portrayed by painter Lavinia Fontana in the
1580s, at their farm in Sala (a few miles from Bologna) employed two renowned
experts in their field. Francesco Valentino Barbieri, the ‘estate manager’ [<i>fattore</i>], who in 1632 had overall
responsibility for the family’s thirty-three horses, and Pellegrino Ortolani, called
the ‘stableman’ [<i>cavallaro</i>], who
compiled a list of the horses. The list is catalogued amongst several other
manuscripts that detail a variety of equine medications, including unguents to
treat skin and hair, and instructions for bloodletting [<a href="https://renaissanceskin.ac.uk/themes/living/%23image_thumb111">https://renaissanceskin.ac.uk/themes/living/#image_thumb111</a>]. Each horse
is recorded by name, as well as the animal’s age, colour, and any significant
markings. The fact that individual, even affectionate names, as well as comments
on the horses’ behaviour were included evidences the powerful bond that existed
between humans and their horses in this period. </p>

                      <h3>Surviving Heatwaves in Seventeenth-Century Florence</h3> <p>

<div class="page-content">
    
    
    <p>Between the end of June and the beginning of
July 2019 Europe has been hit by a worrying heatwave, which beyond any
reasonable doubt is due to the global warming of the planet. In Italy, June 27
2019 has been one of the hottest day in history since temperatures are
regularly recorded. The sight of children bathing in fountains and elders
seeking refreshment in rivers is not just a contemporary one.</p><p><br/></p>

<p>By the beginning of the seventeenth century
Europe saw a drop of temperatures which led some historians to speak about a
“little ice age,” bringing with it systematic social problems such as famines
and increasing the devastating effects of the European wars of the period –
especially in northern Europe. On a less easily perceivable scale, and in
southern regions, occasional heatwaves must have been especially problematic in
the face of a general cooling of the environment.</p><p><br/></p>

<p>The Gozzadini archives at the Biblioteca
dell’Archiginnasio of Bologna host the correspondence of Brandoligi Gozzadini
with his father in the period between 1661-1675, covering the adolescence of
Brandoligi [all references from: Biblioteca Comunale dell’Archiginnasio di
Bologna (BCAB), Gozzadini, Corrispondenza, XII, vol. 38]. Brandoligi, the son
of the powerful senatorial family of the Gozzadini, was sent by his father
Marcantonio to Florence as young page at the Medici court; the correspondence
is a sort of an account of a court education. Pages learned how to serve at the
table, to take care of noblemen, but also to ride, dance, fence, and were
educated in the arts and sciences. This rich correspondence contains notes on
fashion, food, clothing, horses, contact with Ottoman slaves, the use of
microscopes, studying Galileian philosophy, the threat of smallpox, etc. One
interesting topic is fighting heatwaves by taking advantage of the water of the
Arno river. On July 20, 1669,
the young page wrote to his father: </p>

<p> </p>

<p>“The delay of my reply is due to
the fact that we go bathing every day, and we study the whole morning. But
given this burning sun (<i>Sol Leone</i>)
the teachers have been sent on vacation, and I will have more time to write.
This heatwave is terrible and no
one here, not even the elders, remember anything even close to this heat; if it
wasn’t for the cooling effects of bathing
in the Arno, I would not know how to fight this weather.”</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Sometimes bathing was not possible though, and Brandoligi shows a pretty
accurate knowledge of the natural environment he was living in. Three years
before, he wrote:</p><p><br/></p>

<p>“This heat
has really been treating us badly: it is not raining here in Florence, but it
rains up in the mountains where the Arno springs, and for this reason its
waters are murky and muddy, and we cannot go to swim, and we are so sad about
it.”</p><p><br/></p>

<p>Overheating the body was a serious problem for early moderns, since it
could bring about different sorts of internal illnesses. Managing the
temperature of the skin, the external protective layer of the body, could prove
crucial. Besides bathing during heatwaves, too much dancing at parties could
prove to be dangerous, and in such occasions opening the skin and the veins
could be the right thing to do. In the spring of 1670 Brandoligi wrote:</p><p><br/></p>

<p>“Last Tuesday I haven’t written to Your Most
Illustrious Lordship because I took some medicament since I am overheated; to
tell the truth, this is because I have
danced and drunk too much, and I now take refreshing syrups and I have
blood drawn from my vein.” </p><p><br/></p><p>Image: Giuseppe Zocchi, <i>Lungarno e Ponte alle Grazie in Florence</i>

                      <h3>Dealing with the pale-faced girls of Delft: Pieter van Foreest and cosmetic medicine</h3> <p>

<div class="page-content">
    
    
    <p>Physicians were
among the many providers of cosmetic recipes and preparations in the early
modern marketplace, competing with surgeons, apothecaries, empirics, and female
healers, apart from the sphere of household medicine, where cosmetics play a
prominent role in domestic receipt books compiled by women. </p><p><br/></p>

<p>Pieter van Foreest (1521 – 1597) was Dutch physician,
who studied initially at Leuven, then at Bologna, with periods spent in Padua
and Ferrara. He gained experience by working in Rome and Paris and he returned
to his hometown of Alkmaar in 1543 where he practiced as a physician, later
moving to Delft where he was employed as a town physician for nearly forty
years. His most important work was the <i>Observationes</i>, in which he
detailed the ailments and treatment of individual patients. Numbering c. 1350
cases in all, these were later supplemented by the <i>Scholia </i>(commentary)
for each case, which extensively cited authorities and supplemental recipes. It
was published in various editions in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,
and cemented Foreest’s reputation as one of the most prominent physicians in
the Netherlands. The short volume in which Foreest collects his cases regarding
improving the complexion is named <i>De Fucis</i> (On cosmetics) and consists
of eleven observations, with accompanying <i>scholia</i> for each one. Subjects
covered in Foreest’s <i>De fucis</i> ranged from pustules to whitening skin or
dealing with obesity.  </p><p><br/></p>

<p>Each one concerns a different
complaint, and starts with describing a patient or patients, with identifying
information such as their location and the date, such an ‘an aristocratic
canoness from Leusden in 1590’ or  ‘Eva
van Teijlingen, my very dearest wife’.  Interestingly, apart from the pockmarks of
children, all of the cases cited by Foreest involve female patients, which may suggest
that they made up the bulk of his patients seeking to remedy flaws in their
complexion.  This would be followed by
assorted recipes of the prescriptions utilised to remedy the issue. References
to medical authorities in print are most copious in the <i>Scholia</i>, but
also appear in <i>Observationes</i>. Van Foreest would often include references
to the medical practice on the subject by other physicians he knew, such as
Gisbertius Horstius or Cornelius of Rotterdam and even his apothecary in
Alkmaar. Regarding other physicians’ works on beauty, he cites Guillaume
Rondelet’s <i>De fucis</i> twice, for pockmarks and when giving the recipe for
the ‘beauty cream of the Duchesse d’Estampes. However this work by Rondelet
(1507-1566), a professor of medicine at Montpellier, was merely a collection of
recipes on beautifying the skin, hands, teeth and hair. Van Foreest is notable
for individualising his patients and their particular complaints, making his
work a helpful contribution in trying to establish the early modern patient
experience in regard to cosmetic medicine. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>A summary of van Foreest’s patients with
their skin and hair afflictions in <i>De fucis</i>:</p><p><br/></p>

<p>Observation I: On skin blemishes<i>. </i></p>

<p><i>Patient</i>: ‘an otherwise attractive girl had facial blemishes
which disfigured her, so she came to consult me on the causes’ (an egg white
wash distilled in an alembic is prescribed for the spots) </p><p><br/></p>

<p>Observation II: on
blemishes, paleness and redness of the face<i>. </i></p>

<p><i>Patients:</i> girls from
Delft with pale faces, due to eating wheat which upset their stomachs.
Prescription: purging. Other recipes given for either excessive paleness or
redness on the face, including using rosewater, lizard blood or bull bile,
recipes for removing blemishes and wrinkles from Gisbertus Horstius and Cornelius
of Rotterdam, used at the hospital of Santa Maria della Consolazione in Rome </p>

<p><br/></p><p>Observation III: on
pustules and impetigo of the face</p>

<p><i>Patient</i>: A girl who
had red pustules on her face. Liniment of burnt mouse poweder and oil
prescribed. Recipes given for pustules and for fresckles, including one test by
van Foreest’s apothecary in Alkmaar. </p>

<p><br/></p><p>Observation IV: On
getting rid of and whitening scars. </p>

<p><i>Patient: </i> ‘Eva van Teijlingen, my very dearest wife,
due to an accident had on her forehead a scar caused by wound that had not
healed well’. Recipes for recent scars, both fine and thick. Van Foreest noted
that old thick scars were difficult to remedy by recommended a plaster and live
cautery iron if not helpful. Also gives a water to remove all blemishes, colour
and ugliness which he found among the papers of the physician who practiced
before him in Alkmaar. </p>

<p><br/></p><p>Observation V: on
getting rid of the traces of measles and smallpox.</p><p><i>Patients:</i>
particularly children. Recipes by Guillaume Rondelet. De Foreest also
references ointments and waters that he had tested in the Domicella
Sparvvouvvia and Domina de Haesten hospitals, and which appear in another
section of his <i>Medical Observations</i>.</p>

<p><br/></p><p>Observation VI: On
growing hair back. </p>

<p><i>Patient:</i> ‘an
aristocratic canoness in Leusden, 16 February 1590, for a visible regrowth of hair on
the head’. Prescribed a purge, head is shaved and a lotion is applied, followed
by an ointment, recipes for both are supplied.</p>

<p><br/></p><p>Observation VII: on
whitening teeth and getting rid of their faults</p>

<p><br/></p><p>Observation VIII: on scorches
and burns from fire and hot water</p><p>Gives two recipes, and also mentions that he
himself likes using quince paste mixed with rose water. </p>

<p><br/></p><p>Observation IX: On
whitening the skin of the hands and the skin</p>

<p>Gives a recipe used Gilbertus
Hostius in Rome ‘my teacher’ at the Hospital of Santa Maria della Consolazione,
plus other recipes van Foreest has used such as pouring bran-infused buttermilk
or milk and ‘I recommend that young ladies use the innermost part of bread and
ground almonds with bran water’</p>

<p><br/></p><p>Observation X: on
obesity, and how to avoid too much thinness</p>

<p><br/></p><p>Observation XI: on
thinness, and how to avoid getting fatter.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>KWM</p><p><br/></p><p><b>Main Image</b>:<b> </b>Man and Woman at a

                      <h3>Moxibustion</h3> <p>

<div class="page-content">
    
    
    <p>In
1661, the Dutch pastor Hermann Busschof, stationed in colonial Batavia, was seized
by a particularly severe bout of gout. The chronic disease, deemed incurable by
European physicians, attacked its victims with excruciating joint pain, which was
often accompanied by tumorous swellings, most commonly in the foot. After weeks
of suffering and sleeplessness, during which he sought relief to no avail,
Busschof <i>''</i>was persuaded
to suffer an Indian Doctress to come to me, which was of Quinam [Cochinchina], whom
my Wife commonly employed for the curing of our slaves, and who also had been
very successful in recovering my only daughter from a certain difficulty of
breathing. This Indian woman being demanded, whether she knew how to cure that
painful disease which I was molested with; Answered, she did. But to tell you
the truth, it was done by a way of Burning: Which means being by me rejected
out of an apprehension I had of the pain that must needs accompany such a
remedy.''</p><p><br/></p><p>However, the
pastor soon began to regret his cowardly decision and changed his mind once the
pains returned. Having called the ‘Indian doctress’ back, Busschof described
how ''she burned
with her Moxa on my feet and knees about twenty little Escars, which looked
like little gray specks, without raising any blisters, or causing any
after-pain; whereupon also all the pain of the Gout vanish’d.''</p><p><br/></p><p>The practice
described by Busschof was that of moxibustion, a traditional Chinese medical
therapy, which was also employed in the Japanese and other regional medical
systems. As Busschof explained, moxibustion entailed the burning on the patient’s
skin of moxa, or pellets made of “a very soft and woolly substance, crafted by a very
skilful preparation out of a certain dried Herb”. The Japanese name of this
herb, <i>mogusa</i> (a species of mugwort, <i>Artemisia</i> spp.), was
Romanised by Busschof to coin the term ‘moxa’. The purpose of this method was
to draw out and dispel noxious vapours and winds, considered as the main cause
of disease in Chinese and Japanese traditions. </p><p></p><p></p>

    <p><br/></p><p>Busschof’s
astonishing recovery persuaded him to compile a treatise, which was originally
published in Amsterdam in 1675, and within which, the ‘miraculous remedy’ was introduced
to European readers. The pastor conceived of his work as a Socratic dialogue
between the sceptical Theophilus, who doubted every claim and observation presented,
and the patient teacher Theodidactus, whose reasoned
replies eventually dispelled his interlocuter’s doubts. The treatise introduced
moxibustion as an infallible remedy for gout, among other ailments, and
criticised European physicians for their arrogance and misunderstanding of the
true cause of the disease, which Busschof believed was the main reason why “<i>the Gout had been
left for incurable</i>.” He offered an alternative explanation for the origin of
gout, which combined elements of Chinese and humoural medical systems: he
reasoned that the disease was caused by noxious vapours (as the Chinese believed),
which he described in humoural terms as dry and cold. In turning to winds as
the source of disease, Busschof invoked the authority of the ancient medical
treatise <i>De Flatibus</i> (‘On Winds’), attributed to Hippocrates, as well as
that of “the Chinese Doctors [who] are all of that mind” too. </p><p><br/></p><p>Given
their cold and airy nature, Busschof argued that the noxious winds could be
drawn out and dispelled with the use of heat and fire. Cauterisation, either
through red-hot iron or various caustic remedies, had a long tradition in
European medicine. However, as Busschof’s initial reluctance to undergo the
procedure affirms, burning was often feared as an unnecessarily fierce and
painful procedure, which left unwelcome marks on the skin. Moxibustion, however,
was gentler, safer and “the pain is very tolerable, because the matter […]
burns not unto the very skin,” as Busschof asserted. In consequence, moxa also only
“causes a little grey speck […] which sometimes rises to a wound or blister”
that soon disappears, rather than producing nasty ulcers or deep wounds, which
could disfigure the patient and occasion additional medical problems. For these
reasons, moxa was found to be an “excellent Caustick, preferable to all the
rest”. Busschof’s discussion, built around noxious vapours, the Hippocratic Corpus
and cauterisation, found echoes in two later treatises of moxibustion written
by Willem ten Rhijne (1684) and Engelbert Kaempfer (1712), two Dutch East India
Company physicians who spent some time stationed in Dejima in the Nagasaki bay. In this way, the
Dutchmen sought to reconcile a traditional Chinese therapy with European
medical frameworks and pave the way for its introduction in Europe.</p><p><br/></p>

</div>
    
    
    
    <p>As
an employee of a trading company, Busschof saw moxa as an opportunity for
profit. He invited the Dutch East India Company to start exporting moxa from
Asia, “since it will prove a
gainful commodity in Europe, and be no burthen to ships.” His treatise
concluded with an advertisement that Johan Busschof, his brother living in
Utrecht, can provide expert advice on moxa, alongside its samples. Busschof’s treatise
garnered immediate attention, and translations into English (1676) and German (1677)
quickly followed. Whilst gout remained at the centre of discussions, moxibustion
was experimented with in other ailments too, including toothaches and
neurological issues.</p><p></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Moxa’s reputation
received a further boost through the case of a ‘celebrity patient’: the English
ambassador to the Low Countries, Sir William Temple, who
published an account of his successful recovery from the gout in 1680. In it, Temple
lamented that what first seemed as “some sprain at tennis” developed
into the feared disease. Having heard of his troubles, his Dutch colleague Constantijn
Huygens (the father of the natural philosopher Christiaan) brought Temple a
copy of Busschof’s treatise. After a long, reasoned consideration, Temple
decided to give moxa a try. The outcome exceeded his expectations: he “could
not believe such an effect, which seldom reaches to the degree that is promised
by the prescribers of any remedies.” The news of other successful cases,
alongside Huygens’ instigation, convinced Temple to share his experience in
print. To avoid any accusations of neglect, Temple provided accounts of other
certified gout treatments, including advice from Prince Maurice of Nassau
himself, who “used but one remedy, which was, whenever he felt it, to boil a
good quantity of horsedung [and] set his leg in a pail-full of it.”</p><p><br/></p>

    </div>
    
</div>
    
    
    
    <p>Despite the
successful outcome, Temple’s report introduced first doubts into the narrative.
Temple’s experience of the burning was far from gentle and painless, and his
gout later returned, not once but twice. Although moxibustion brought relief in
both cases, the method could hardly be considered a flawless cure. Moreover, cases
in which moxa failed to produce the desired result entirely began to grow by
the day. The fears of disfiguration of skin, associated with cauterisation,
remained an issue, too. Kaempfer, in his 1712 treatise, did little to dispel
these anxieties. He described that in Japan, “both sexes [are] so full of scars
and marks of former exulcerations, one would imagine that they had undergone a
most severe whipping.” Whilst “according to their notions, their beauty is not
in the least lessen’d thereby,” this would not have been the case in Europe.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>In light of the
growing number of disappointed patients in Europe, Kaempfer accused Busschof of
going “too far, when he recommended the Moxa to his Countrymen as an infallible
remedy for the gout.” To provide an explanation for why moxa happened to fail
so often, Kaempfer turned to differences in climate. He argued that “the like
success cannot be reasonably expected from its application in our colder
European climates,” since “in hot Countries the perspiration is stronger, the
fluids thinner, the pores wider.” Moxa’s reputation was starting to crash
almost as fast as it had initially soared. In 1719, the German surgeon Lorenz
Heister wrote that whilst moxa “may have been cried up by many of the
Europeans, it is at present quite in Disuse, and that not without Reason; for,
besides the acute Pain which it causes, it is frequently found to have little
or no Effect.” Indeed, in the words of Heister’s colleague Johann Junker, by
1722 Busschof’s supposedly infallible remedy “had come out of fashion.”</p>

                      <h3>Dee’s dream and the imperial alchemy of tattooing</h3> <p>

<div class="page-content">
    
    
    <p>On
September 10th, 1579, John Dee made a brief note in his private diaries.  He had had a “dream of being naked, and my
skyn all overwrowght with work like some kinde of tuft mockado, with crosses
blew and red; and on my left arme, abowt the arme, in a wreath, this word I red—
<i>sine me nihil potestis facere</i>: and another the same night
of Mr. Secretary Walsingham, Mr. Candish, and myself.” </p><p><br/></p>

<p>Dee
occasionally described dreams he found particularly significant or worthy of
interpretation, recording them alongside major events like births and deaths
within his household as well as his meetings with Queen Elizabeth, various
aristocratic patrons, and court officials. 
In this dream, he had seen himself marked all over with blue and red
crosses—his skin, as he put it, looking like “tuft
mockado,”
a type of patterned wool fabric which imitated velvet.  Dee had also dreamed that his left arm was
inscribed with a Latin version of a phrase spoken by Jesus in the Gospel of
John: “without me ye can do nothing”.  </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Locating
the subconscious origins of a dream can be difficult, even when it’s your
own.  Finding the inspirations behind Dee’s
dream over 440 years ago can only be speculative, at best—but there are a few
likely influences.  As a practitioner of
the occult arts, Dee, a renowned astrologer and alchemist, would have been
quite familiar with ideas of inking or inscribing skin as an element of magical
practice.  (His contemporary, the would-be
magus Simon Forman, is known to have marked himself on his arm and chest with
the ‘characters’ of Venus, Jupiter, and Cancer during one magical
ceremony.)  Dee was also a scholar of
history, and would have read numerous sources claiming that ancient Britons,
particularly the Picts, had been extensively tattooed; it was a widespread
perception in the late sixteenth century that the ancestors of those inhabiting
the British Isles had had “durable skars” across their bodies and “painted
pownced limmes”.  A third possible
influence, however, might be hinted at in Dee’s other dream from that same
night, when he had dreamed of a visit or conversation between himself,
Secretary of State Francis Walsingham, and “Mr. Candish” (likely Richard
Cavendish, Member of Parliament and uncle to the privateer and explorer Sir
Thomas Cavendish): men closely involved in promoting England’s imperial
interests, particularly overseas colonization in the Americas.  Alchemy, history, and the tattooed
appearances of indigenous Americans were likely all inspirations to Dee’s
sleeping mind.</p><p><br/></p>

    <p>Widely
considered one of the most learned men of England, Dee was often consulted by
Queen Elizabeth and members of her court for his alchemical knowledge and for
his expertise in the navigational arts. 
His advocacy, too, on behalf of Elizabeth’s imperial claims, had brought
him a great deal of royal favor.  Two
years prior to his dream, in November 1577, Dee had “declared to the Quene” and
Secretary Walsingham “her title to Greenland, Estetiland and Friseland” (Estetiland
referred to what is now northeast Canada, and Friseland to southern
Greenland).  His scholarship was
solicited repeatedly by the monarch, her advisors, and advocates of Atlantic
colonization, and Dee wrote multiple treatises on the subject.  Some of his works had explained, with maps,
the most recent geographical knowledge of the North Atlantic region, while
others were historical surveys intended to prove English title to overseas
territories, drawing on evidence which ranged from the reputed westward travels
of King Arthur and St. Brendan to the recent voyages of the Cabots and Martin
Frobisher. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Frobisher’s
Arctic expedition of 1577 had kidnapped three Inuit people who were taken to
England as captives with the intention of utilizing them as interpreters and
displaying them to patrons who might fund future voyages.  One of the three, a woman known as ‘Arnaq’—a
term likely meaning ‘woman’ rather than her true name—died shortly after
Frobisher’s return to Bristol in November 1577, but not before at least two
artists had painted portraits of her with her infant child.  At least one of the paintings, by Cornelis
Ketel, was presented to the Queen and displayed at Hampton Court (the image is
now lost).  The woman’s facial tattoos,
which included blue dots across her cheeks and lines on her chin, struck many
as the crucial element of her self-presentation, prompting significant written
commentary by observers.  William Camden
would later describe the Inuit captives as having “black hair, broad faces,
flat noses...the women painted about the eyes and balls of the cheek with a
blue colour like that of the ancient Britons.”</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Did
Dee see her portrait?  Perhaps.  He certainly heard reports of her and the
other New World captives as he prepared his manuscripts on “Imperium Brytanicum”
and met with other advocates of Northwest Passage exploration, including Sir
Humphrey Gilbert and Richard Hakluyt. 
Without more details of how Dee interpreted his dream it’s impossible to
know whether he directly connected his vision of his “skyn all overwrowght with
work” with the tattooed captives who had been brought from the “Estetiland” he
thought and wrote about so often. 
However, as an occultist who understood the powerful magical potential
in marking the body to influence events, as well as a bold advocate of Britain’s
imperial claims, Dee must have reflected carefully on the messages inscribed
within his dreaming skin. </p><p><br/></p><p>Guest blog courtesy of Mairin Odle</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><i>Dr. Mairin Odle is an assistant professor of American

                      <h3>The Pilgrim Tattoo</h3> <p>

<div class="page-content">
    
    
    <p>The tattoo has long been thought an exotic
eighteenth-century import to Europe, brought back on the skin of sailors from
the islands of the South Seas. But though the Tahitian word <i>tattau</i> first
came into English as <i>tattow</i> in the late eighteenth century through
captain James Cook’s (1728-1779) account of his voyages to Polynesia, the
practice of permanently marking the skin with needles and ink had existed in
Europe from earliest times and was part of Europeans' everyday lives. In fact, when
early seventeenth-century colonists described the painting and tattooing they
observed on the skin of the native inhabitants of the so-called New World, they
referred their readers to what was apparently an easy modern-day point of
reference: the cross of Jerusalem that, along with several other designs,
commonly adorned the bodies of European pilgrims returning from the Holy Land. As
Recollet missionary Gabriel Sagard-Théodat (†1636) explains in his 1632 <i>Grand
voyage du pays des Hurons</i>, the Amerindian tattoo “is pricked and made in
the same way as are made and engraved on the flesh’s surface the Crosses that
those returning from Jerusalem have on their arms, and it lasts forever.” Whether
they knew someone who had gotten tattooed or had only read about it, the
Jerusalem tattoo was a familiar commodity for Europeans of this period, a
legible and legitimate form of permanent body marking worn by those Christians
curious, brave, pious, or wealthy enough to have made the demanding journey. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Pilgrims regularly planned leisure time
into their Holy Land travel itineraries to have themselves “marked” by
Christian locals in Bethlehem or in Jerusalem at the site of the Church of the
Holy Sepulcher, most often choosing their designs from a number of wood-block
patterns. Jean de Thévenot (1633–1665), whose extensive wanderings included
time in Palestine, describes the tattooing process in his popular 1665 <i>Relation d’un Voyage fait au Levant</i>: “We
took all of Tuesday April 29 to have our arms marked, as ordinarily all
Pilgrims do, it is the Christians of Bethlehem following the Latin rite who do
this. They have several wooden blocks, from which you choose the ones that
please you the most, then they fill them with powdered charcoal, then they
apply them to you, so that they leave the mark of what is engraved. After that
with their left hand they hold your arm whose skin is stretched taut, and in
their right hand they have a little cane where there are two needles, that they
dip from time to time into ink mixed with ox bile, and prick you with it
following the lines marked by the wood block. . . . This surely hurts, and
ordinarily provokes a fever that lasts but a short time, and the arms stay
swollen to about three times their normal size during two or three days. After
they have pricked the whole length of all these lines, they wash the arm, and
look to see if there is any error, and if so they start again, and sometimes
they go back over it up to three times. When they are done, they wrap your arm
very tightly, and a scab forms that falls off two or three days later, and the
marks remain blue, and never erase themselves, because the blood mixing with
this pigment made of ink and ox bile, still shows inside under the skin.”</p><p><br/></p>

    <p>Whatever other reasons Europeans may have
had for traveling to the Levant, a sincere desire to gain physical proximity to
the places where Christ and his entourage had lived and died strongly motivated
those who made the journey. Most Holy Land pilgrims had themselves tattooed
with scenes from Christ’s passion—Christ dying on Calvary, triumphantly rising
from the dead above the Holy Sepulcher, or ascending into heaven from the Mount
of Olives—as are clearly visible in this engraving of the arms of Hamburg
native Ratge Stubbe, who traveled to the Holy Land in 1669. Stubbe’s right arm
displays the Jerusalem cross, a potent cross with four crosslets that forms the
center of the composite Jerusalem-Bethlehem seal, also partially visible on the
right arm of the unknown pilgrim whose portrait is featured here, with the
incomplete year of his pilgrimage beneath it, “166 .” The Jerusalem cross is flanked
on either side by the palm branches of Bethphage, the town on the outskirts of
Jerusalem where Christ first entered the city, welcomed by people laying
branches on his path. Above these symbols are the three crowns of the Magi,
and, at top center, the Bethlehem star. In Stubbe’s case, the seal is framed
above and below by the names of the two holy cities in Roman capitals, with the
date of his pilgrimage below.<br/></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Also featured in the portrait on the
pilgrim’s right arm is a large rectangular shape with pointed appendages that reproduces
the floor plan of the Grotto of the Nativity in Bethlehem, the main chapel
beneath the Church of the Nativity, celebrated as the birthplace of Christ. The
custom tattooed map represents in detail the steps the pilgrim followed down
into the subterranean chapel, the star he gazed upon and embraced, and the
altars he knelt at in prayer, preserving forever in corporeal form the space
through which his own body had passed. Similarly, the tattoo on the pilgrim’s
left inner arm commemorates his visit to Nazareth, the birthplace of Christ, just
as Stubbe’s tattoos memorialize his time at the Holy Sepulcher, Calvary, and
the Mount of Olives. By reproducing monuments upon their skin, pilgrims thus
made their own bodies living memorials to the physical and spiritual experience
of traveling in the footsteps of Christ. Moreover, their tattoos offered
enduring and infinitely portable mementos they could gaze on long after
returning home, an emphasis on the visual consistent with the Catholic Reformation
valorization of the image as a privileged medium for meditation. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Tattoos held not only spiritual meaning,
but conferred worldly status as well. If returning pilgrims of the upper
classes chose to commission engravings of their tattoos and portraits in which
they proudly displayed their tattooed arms, it was because their tattoos had
extraordinary value for the fashioning of their identities. Once Holy Land pilgrims
reintegrated their communities, like honorary insignia, their tattoos
distinguished them among their peers as having made the arduous journey to
Palestine, contributing to an enterprise of self-fashioning that brought them
enduring social prestige. In this portrait, the painter reinforces his
subject’s identity as a man who has successfully traveled to foreign lands by placing
a waiting ship in the background, the curtain drawn to show it, just as the
man’s sleeves are purposefully pushed up to reveal his tattoos, the undone
button hole featured prominently at center. The inclusion of a document that
appears to be a certificate of induction into an honorary brotherhood, placed
in parallel with the pilgrim’s tattooed arms that hold and gesture toward it,
further reinforces the importance of his tattoos themselves as signs of
distinction.</p>

                              <h3>The Pilgrim Tattoo</h3> 

<div class="page-content">
    
    
    <p>The tattoo has long been thought an exotic
eighteenth-century import to Europe, brought back on the skin of sailors from
the islands of the South Seas. But though the Tahitian word <i>tattau</i> first
came into English as <i>tattow</i> in the late eighteenth century through
captain James Cook’s (1728-1779) account of his voyages to Polynesia, the
practice of permanently marking the skin with needles and ink had existed in
Europe from earliest times and was part of Europeans' everyday lives. In fact, when
early seventeenth-century colonists described the painting and tattooing they
observed on the skin of the native inhabitants of the so-called New World, they
referred their readers to what was apparently an easy modern-day point of
reference: the cross of Jerusalem that, along with several other designs,
commonly adorned the bodies of European pilgrims returning from the Holy Land. As
Recollet missionary Gabriel Sagard-Théodat (†1636) explains in his 1632 <i>Grand
voyage du pays des Hurons</i>, the Amerindian tattoo “is pricked and made in
the same way as are made and engraved on the flesh’s surface the Crosses that
those returning from Jerusalem have on their arms, and it lasts forever.” Whether
they knew someone who had gotten tattooed or had only read about it, the
Jerusalem tattoo was a familiar commodity for Europeans of this period, a
legible and legitimate form of permanent body marking worn by those Christians
curious, brave, pious, or wealthy enough to have made the demanding journey. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Pilgrims regularly planned leisure time
into their Holy Land travel itineraries to have themselves “marked” by
Christian locals in Bethlehem or in Jerusalem at the site of the Church of the
Holy Sepulcher, most often choosing their designs from a number of wood-block
patterns. Jean de Thévenot (1633–1665), whose extensive wanderings included
time in Palestine, describes the tattooing process in his popular 1665 <i>Relation d’un Voyage fait au Levant</i>: “We
took all of Tuesday April 29 to have our arms marked, as ordinarily all
Pilgrims do, it is the Christians of Bethlehem following the Latin rite who do
this. They have several wooden blocks, from which you choose the ones that
please you the most, then they fill them with powdered charcoal, then they
apply them to you, so that they leave the mark of what is engraved. After that
with their left hand they hold your arm whose skin is stretched taut, and in
their right hand they have a little cane where there are two needles, that they
dip from time to time into ink mixed with ox bile, and prick you with it
following the lines marked by the wood block. . . . This surely hurts, and
ordinarily provokes a fever that lasts but a short time, and the arms stay
swollen to about three times their normal size during two or three days. After
they have pricked the whole length of all these lines, they wash the arm, and
look to see if there is any error, and if so they start again, and sometimes
they go back over it up to three times. When they are done, they wrap your arm
very tightly, and a scab forms that falls off two or three days later, and the
marks remain blue, and never erase themselves, because the blood mixing with
this pigment made of ink and ox bile, still shows inside under the skin.”</p><p><br/></p>

    <p>Whatever other reasons Europeans may have
had for traveling to the Levant, a sincere desire to gain physical proximity to
the places where Christ and his entourage had lived and died strongly motivated
those who made the journey. Most Holy Land pilgrims had themselves tattooed
with scenes from Christ’s passion—Christ dying on Calvary, triumphantly rising
from the dead above the Holy Sepulcher, or ascending into heaven from the Mount
of Olives—as are clearly visible in this engraving of the arms of Hamburg
native Ratge Stubbe, who traveled to the Holy Land in 1669. Stubbe’s right arm
displays the Jerusalem cross, a potent cross with four crosslets that forms the
center of the composite Jerusalem-Bethlehem seal, also partially visible on the
right arm of the unknown pilgrim whose portrait is featured here, with the
incomplete year of his pilgrimage beneath it, “166 .” The Jerusalem cross is flanked
on either side by the palm branches of Bethphage, the town on the outskirts of
Jerusalem where Christ first entered the city, welcomed by people laying
branches on his path. Above these symbols are the three crowns of the Magi,
and, at top center, the Bethlehem star. In Stubbe’s case, the seal is framed
above and below by the names of the two holy cities in Roman capitals, with the
date of his pilgrimage below.<br/></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Also featured in the portrait on the
pilgrim’s right arm is a large rectangular shape with pointed appendages that reproduces
the floor plan of the Grotto of the Nativity in Bethlehem, the main chapel
beneath the Church of the Nativity, celebrated as the birthplace of Christ. The
custom tattooed map represents in detail the steps the pilgrim followed down
into the subterranean chapel, the star he gazed upon and embraced, and the
altars he knelt at in prayer, preserving forever in corporeal form the space
through which his own body had passed. Similarly, the tattoo on the pilgrim’s
left inner arm commemorates his visit to Nazareth, the birthplace of Christ, just
as Stubbe’s tattoos memorialize his time at the Holy Sepulcher, Calvary, and
the Mount of Olives. By reproducing monuments upon their skin, pilgrims thus
made their own bodies living memorials to the physical and spiritual experience
of traveling in the footsteps of Christ. Moreover, their tattoos offered
enduring and infinitely portable mementos they could gaze on long after
returning home, an emphasis on the visual consistent with the Catholic Reformation
valorization of the image as a privileged medium for meditation. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Tattoos held not only spiritual meaning,
but conferred worldly status as well. If returning pilgrims of the upper
classes chose to commission engravings of their tattoos and portraits in which
they proudly displayed their tattooed arms, it was because their tattoos had
extraordinary value for the fashioning of their identities. Once Holy Land pilgrims
reintegrated their communities, like honorary insignia, their tattoos
distinguished them among their peers as having made the arduous journey to
Palestine, contributing to an enterprise of self-fashioning that brought them
enduring social prestige. In this portrait, the painter reinforces his
subject’s identity as a man who has successfully traveled to foreign lands by placing
a waiting ship in the background, the curtain drawn to show it, just as the
man’s sleeves are purposefully pushed up to reveal his tattoos, the undone
button hole featured prominently at center. The inclusion of a document that
appears to be a certificate of induction into an honorary brotherhood, placed
in parallel with the pilgrim’s tattooed arms that hold and gesture toward it,
further reinforces the importance of his tattoos themselves as signs of
distinction.</p>

                      <h3>Smooth Skin</h3> <p>

<div class="page-content">
    
    
    <p>Skin has featured prominently as
a site of cross-cultural encounter in studies of colonial interactions. In
addition to aspects such as skin colour and skin markings, European observers
commented extensively on the purported smoothness of indigenous skins. For
example, the <i>Decades</i> (1530) of the Italian historian in Spanish service,
Peter Martyr d’Anghiera, described the Spanish explorers’ perception of the
appearance of indigenous women of Hispaniola, whose “faces, chests, breasts,
hands and other body parts were exceedingly smooth.” In his sexualised, almost
paradisiacal portrayal, Peter compared the naked women to “the most beautiful
Dryads, forest nymphs or fountain fairies spoken of by the ancients.” Similar
tropes find echoes across early Spanish reports from the new worlds, many of
which brought the readers’ attention to the clean, nude skin of newly encountered
peoples, with a particular focus on women. According to these accounts, various
practices contributed to the smooth and clean appearance of indigenous skin: regular
bathing and the application of ointments, as well as removal of facial and body
hair. Indigenous care for their skin made a deep impression on Spanish writers
who struggled to reconcile their view of the apparent barbarity of naked
indigenes with the sophisticated attention they paid to their bodies. How were
these frictions negotiated in early Spanish reports?</p><p><br/></p>

<p>Both in the Americas and the
Philippines, one of the observations that most surprised the Spanish was the frequency
with which indigenous people bathed: sometimes even three or four times a day.
According to the Italian explorer in the service of Spain, Amerigo Vespucci
(1454–1512), it was “due to their frequent bathing” that the “bodies [of
Mesoamerican indigenes] are very smooth and clean.” Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo
confirmed Vespucci’s observations in his <i>Historia general de las Indias</i>
(1535), whilst adding a condescending remark that “if they go one or two days
without washing, they develop a foul stench like that of the Black people of
Guinea, which in some is unbearable.” In the Philippines, by contrast, bathing
played into civilisational hierarchies in a different way. In the <a href="https://renaissanceskin.ac.uk/themes/defining/#image_thumb167"><i>Boxer
Codex</i></a>, the author of an account of the Visayan people wrote that “both
men and women bathe publicly once or twice a day, their bodies entirely exposed,
but they do cover their private parts with their hands until submerged.” Whereas
Oviedo sought to construct parallels between indigenous Americans and Black
Africans, who were increasingly brought into the Iberian territories in
shackles as slaves, the <i>Boxer Codex</i> underscored the Visayans’ innate
modesty, suggestive of the hope that they would become civil subjects of the
Castilian Crown. </p><p><br/></p>

<p>Filipino indigenes shared the
European understanding of bathing as a medical practice, for “it is in their
baths that they find their best medicines.” The inhabitants of Manila held in
particular regard the hot springs in today’s Los Baños, “some 12 miles up the
stream” from the Spanish capital, which the indigenes frequented especially when
suffering from various skin ailments. Already in 1592, Franciscan missionaries
established the <i>Hospital of the Holy Waters</i> at the site. Spanish
colonial hospitals were typically organised along ethnic lines, reflecting the
Spanish colonial policies of segregation and hierarchisation. For example, in
Manila, there were separate institutions for Spanish royal subjects, indigenous
people and the Chinese minority. In Los Baños, however, “many Spaniards, indigenes
and those of other nations, both men and women (who have separate quarters), were
treated for cold humours and buboes.” In the hot waters of Los Baños, the
Spanish policy of ethnic segregation dissolved.</p><p><br/></p>

<p>In addition to bathing, the
smoothness of indigenous skin in both Spanish America and the Philippines was associated
with the removal of facial and body hair. As Oviedo described in his account of
Spanish America, despite variations in customs and appearance “all the
indigenes are commonly without beards; so much so that it is a marvel to see
any men or women to have any hair on their faces or other parts of the body.” For
Oviedo, this was a prime marker of difference between the indigenes and “the
Christians.” In the Philippines, likewise, “neither men, nor women suffer hair
to grow on their bodies, except on their scalps.” The removal of beards, which
were <a href="https://renaissanceskin.ac.uk/themes/defining/#image_thumb136">understood
as a sign of manhood and virility in European cultures</a>, drew particular
attention. As the English physician John Bulwer summarised in his <i>Anthropometamorphosis</i>
(1650), “shaving the Chin is justly to be accounted a note of Effeminacy,” practised
only by “scoffers of Nature, who with their Pincers fight against her!” </p><p><br/></p>

<p>Woman, by contrast, “by Nature is
smooth and delicate; and if she have many haires she is a Monster,” according
to Bulwer. Women both in the Americas and the Philippines further underlined
the smoothness and cleanliness of their bodies by using ointments and
sweet-smelling perfumes. Filipino women were reported to use sesame oil infused
with civet musk, two precious medical commodities to Europe. Therefore, whereas
their hairless faces and bodies turned indigenous men into inferior and
effeminate individuals, the smooth skin of their female counterparts made them
all the more desirable in Spanish eyes.</p><p><br/></p>

<p>The smooth indigenous body provided
a rich source of metaphors for Spanish colonisers. The outward cleanliness of
indigenous bodies raised questions about their inner, moral purity, which was
dealt with differently by authors depending on their motivations. The Spanish
soldier and later prominent official stationed in the Philippines, Antonio de
Morga, wrote in 1609 that “the very clean and tidy” attitude towards their
“physique and clothing” mirrored the Filipinos’ “pleasing character and grace.”
Vespucci, by way of contrast, insisted that the “smooth and clean bodies” of
Mesoamerican indigenes could not be taken as a reflection of their character,
as “they are in all other things filthy and without shame” – especially with
respect to their sexual activity.</p><p><br/></p>

<p>Smooth skin also raised questions
of indigenous agency. Kathleen Brown has argued that European writers commonly
attributed the physical differences between themselves and the Amerindians to
culture, rather than nature, due to the indigenes’ agency in treating their
bodies and crafting their appearance. These representations contrasted sharply
with the passive portrayal of enslaved Black Africans whose appearance was
attributed primarily to the influences of climate or the biblical curse of Ham.
At the same time, however, the smooth and clean indigenous body was interpreted
as an invitation for the colonisers to leave their mark. In the preface to his
1555 English edition of early Spanish accounts of the Americas, Richard Eden
wrote that “these simple gentiles lyvinge only after the lawe of nature, may
well bee lykened to a smoothe and bare table unpainted, or a white paper
unwritten, upon which yow may at the fyrst paynte or wryte what yow lyste.” The
smooth indigenous body thus offered a blank slate to be inscribed at will by
the coloniser.</p><p><br/></p><p>SK</p><p><br/></p><p>Image: Amerigo Vespucci’s encounter with

At the same time, however, the smooth and clean indigenous body was interpreted
as an invitation for the colonisers to leave their mark. In the preface to his
1555 English edition of early Spanish accounts of the Americas, Richard Eden
wrote that “these simple gentiles lyvinge only after the lawe of nature, may
well bee lykened to a smoothe and bare table unpainted, or a white paper
unwritten, upon which yow may at the fyrst paynte or wryte what yow lyste.” The
smooth indigenous body thus offered a blank slate to be inscribed at will by
the coloniser.</p><p><br/></p><p>SK</p><p><br/></p><p>Image: Amerigo Vespucci’s encounter with

                      <h3>Skin to Skin with Exotic Beasts, Part 1</h3> <p>

<div class="page-content">
    
    
    <p>Renaissance portraits often draw on the trope of the connection
between powerful people and powerful animals. 
Out-of-the-ordinary creatures
were linked with the ruler in their special characteristics, including
qualities of enviable skins. Exotic animals demonstrated their owners’
expansive horizons, their ability to possess items of the utmost rarity and
expense, and their role as exemplars of the biblical command to claim dominion
over all creatures (Genesis 1:26). 
Lions or leopards, for instance, submitted to a hierarchy of dominion and
were rendered tame to the ruler alone, in recognition of his rightful
authority: over his animal; his household; his state; and beyond, over the
natural, political and social worlds.</p><p><br/></p>

<p>In this vein, rather than a little dog that might sleep at the
foot of his subjects’ beds, Francis I of France was said to have slept in the company of a
lion or other ferocious pet. (According to Pierre Belon du Mans, <i>L’Histoire de la nature des oyseaux…</i> (Paris:
Benoît Prévost, 1555), livre III, ch. 2: ‘comme nous tenons quelque petit chien
pur compagnie, que faisons coucher sur les pieds de nostre lict pour plaisir:
iceluy y avoit telles fois quelque Lion, Once, ou autre telle fiere beste’.) 
</p><p><br/></p>

<p>Portraits of Don Juan
of Austria (illegitimate son of Charles V) and Ladislaus von Fraunberg, count
of Haag, show these men’s
princely virility and martial prowess and, while the count’s face bears a
cragginess of mature experience, both sitters boast fair and healthy skin.  Next to Don Juan and Count Ladislaus are
their exotic companion cats, whose plush fur contrasts with the skin of their
owners.  The lion and leopard are
representative of international deeds: Don Juan had taken the lion – who
he named Austria - when he captured Tunis, and Count Ladislaus was given his
leopard in Italy. Beyond
the symbolic, these cats are also living animals (Austria reportedly slept in Don
Juan’s rooms; the leopard was said to have been always in Ladislaus’s company,
like a dog).  They are portrayed in a
proximity that for anyone else might be lethal, but beside their owners
represents a close companionship. </p><p><br/></p>

The artists pay intricate attention to the texture and
markings of the animals’ coats, akin to the care paid to the luxurious textiles
in the possession of the sitters, creating ensembles of tactile
sumptuousness.  The viewer is invited to
imagine laying their hand upon velvety, silky, soft surfaces.  But, even though appealing to touch in the
imagination, Austria the lion and the leopard of Haag are not the same as
carpet or curtain: they are deadly creatures.<p><br/></p>

    <p>While Austria was taken
from within the fortress of Tunis (perhaps already tamed), he was nevertheless
to be equated with local wild lions, whose ferocity is described by Gonzalo
Argote de Molina. Such was the aggressiveness of these Tunisian lions, for
example, that one had attacked a hunting party led by Don Garcia de Toledo, the
lion leaping up to drag a rider from his horse and submitting the horse to a
vicious attack, ripping into human and animal skin. Another time, during a hunt
by Don Rodrigo de Benavides, a lion had been so frightening to encounter that a
horse had dropped dead upon sight of the beast, an autopsy concluding the hidden
cause of death to be a ruptured gall bladder brought on by terror.  While Don Juan’s Austria dutifully lies by
his heels, visibly under perfect control of his owner, the lion’s muscular
body, large claws, and fierce glare straight at the viewer are reminders not to
mess with Don Juan and that this is not an animal for the rank and file.</p><p><br/></p>

<p>Ladislaus’s leopard,
whose name we do not know, does not make eye contact with the viewer, but gazes
to the side like his owner, with the look of an animal alert and interested in
the hunt, ready to bring down enemies. 
Like Austria, this animal is perfectly docile towards his owner, a
creature in whom he can truly trust, the leopard’s strong, spotted body is
almost intertwined with Ladislaus’s legs. 
Count and cat match each other, collared (the leopard’s bearing
Ladislaus’s initials), and handsomely patterned in tones of black and
gold. Ladislaus’s leopard is at once
like a dog, but decidedly not a dog.  This portrait
should be compared with Hans Mielich’s earlier portrayal of Ladislaus’s great
enemy Duke Albrecht V of Bavaria with an imposing but less elegant lion.  Count Ladislaus’s
political position was insecure in this period, and the portrait’s elaborate
iconographic scheme and careful messaging attempt to present an image of righteousness
and international clout.  It is not
surprising that the count’s leopard is given a principal role in this display. </p><p><br/></p>

<p>Renaissance court portraits depicting noble or royal sitters
with rare companion animals can therefore reveal much about contemporary ideals
of high-status human and animal skin, and about the depiction of power of
elites over other people and over nature. 
Furthermore these images suggest the relationship of sitters to actual,
sentient animals with whom they lived in surprising intimacy. </p>

<div class="page-content">
    
    
    <p>Following from the previous blogpost on male sitters with big
cats, two images from the Spanish court illustrate how elite female sitters
could also be depicted with rare companion animals, to indicate gendered virtue
and stately power, even from childhood. Sofonisba Anguissola’s portrait of Infanta Catalina Micaela and Alonso Sánchez
Coello’s portrait of the infanta with her sister Isabella Clara
Eugenia both depict smooth luminous skin of the girls alongside the impressive skin of
exotic animal companions. The artists bounce light on human and animal skins
and features, and on flowers, textiles, metals and jewels. Anguissola portrays
both of Catalina Micaela’s unblemished white hands on silken fur as she pets
and gently cradles her golden-chained marmoset (<i>Callithrix jacchus</i>), an
emblem of its Brazilian homeland and the colonial reach and ambition of
Catalina’s father, Philip II. </p><p><br/></p><p>In Sánchez Coello’s portrait, the two sisters’ pearlescent skin meets the fluffy coat of a dainty miniature spaniel and the vivid green feathers of an Indian parakeet (<i>Psittacula krameri</i>), the colour of the plumage echoed in the girls’ dazzling outfits. These precious, enchanting little animals are fitting for their owners, and, while other such creatures might misbehave, jump around, yap, shriek, make mess or smells, scratch or bite the soft skin that caresses them, the animals in these portraits are perfectly portable, gentle, and obedient to the authority of the young infantas. <br/></p><p><br/></p>

    <p><br/></p><p>Sitters such as the Infantas Isabella Clara Eugenia and Catalina Micaela,
and Don Juan, and Count Ladislaus in the previous blogpost, are portrayed skin
to skin with exotics. In such portraits, the faultless skins of exceptional humans and
animals combine with other markers of magnificence to create a demonstration of
dynastic power and virtuous splendour.  The extent of real, lived interspecies bonds
behind palace doors is not always easy to establish from these sources, nor is
the real-life tractability or unruliness of these animals.  But the message in these portraits, and
writings such as those of Pierre Belon and Gonzalo
Argote de Molina, is clear: these people do not just have the
chance to look at striking animals in palace menageries; or wear furs of
remarkable creatures and feel these against their skin; they also get to touch
living fur, run their fingers through beautiful and unusual pelts from faraway
places as they go about the business of their days, play with delightful and thrilling
companions, even feel the heat from breathing beastly bodies at their feet in
bed.<br/></p><p><br/></p>

<p>These portraits are not just about ideal skins, human and
animal, they are also about interactions of special skins, interactions at once
familiar to the viewer - who might too stroke a cat or dog or bird – but also
interactions, relationships and sensations out of the range of all but the few.</p><p><br/></p><p>SC</p>

cats, two images from the Spanish court illustrate how elite female sitters
could also be depicted with rare companion animals, to indicate gendered virtue
and stately power, even from childhood. Sofonisba Anguissola’s portrait of Infanta Catalina Micaela and Alonso Sánchez
Coello’s portrait of the infanta with her sister Isabella Clara
Eugenia both depict smooth luminous skin of the girls alongside the impressive skin of
exotic animal companions. The artists bounce light on human and animal skins
and features, and on flowers, textiles, metals and jewels. Anguissola portrays
both of Catalina Micaela’s unblemished white hands on silken fur as she pets
and gently cradles her golden-chained marmoset (<i>Callithrix jacchus</i>), an
emblem of its Brazilian homeland and the colonial reach and ambition of
Catalina’s father, Philip II. </p><p><br/></p><p>In Sánchez Coello’s portrait, the two sisters’ pearlescent skin meets the fluffy coat of a dainty miniature spaniel and the vivid green feathers of an Indian parakeet (<i>Psittacula krameri</i>), the colour of the plumage echoed in the girls’ dazzling outfits. These precious, enchanting little animals are fitting for their owners, and, while other such creatures might misbehave, jump around, yap, shriek, make mess or smells, scratch or bite the soft skin that caresses them, the animals in these portraits are perfectly portable, gentle, and obedient to the authority of the young infantas. <br/></p><p><br/></p>

    <p><br/></p><p>Sitters such as the Infantas Isabella Clara Eugenia and Catalina Micaela,
and Don Juan, and Count Ladislaus in the previous blogpost, are portrayed skin
to skin with exotics. In such portraits, the faultless skins of exceptional humans and
animals combine with other markers of magnificence to create a demonstration of
dynastic power and virtuous splendour.  The extent of real, lived interspecies bonds
behind palace doors is not always easy to establish from these sources, nor is
the real-life tractability or unruliness of these animals.  But the message in these portraits, and
writings such as those of Pierre Belon and Gonzalo
Argote de Molina, is clear: these people do not just have the
chance to look at striking animals in palace menageries; or wear furs of
remarkable creatures and feel these against their skin; they also get to touch
living fur, run their fingers through beautiful and unusual pelts from faraway
places as they go about the business of their days, play with delightful and thrilling
companions, even feel the heat from breathing beastly bodies at their feet in
bed.<br/></p><p><br/></p>

<p>These portraits are not just about ideal skins, human and
animal, they are also about interactions of special skins, interactions at once
familiar to the viewer - who might too stroke a cat or dog or bird – but also
interactions, relationships and sensations out of the range of all but the few.</p><p><br/></p><p>SC</p>
