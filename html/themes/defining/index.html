                      <h3>Titian&#x27;s Venus of Urbino</h3> <p>

<div class="page-content">
    
    
    <p>One of the best-known paintings of the
Italian Renaissance, Titian's <i>Venus of
Urbino</i> (1538) is a touchstone for the ideas and questions behind the
Renaissance Skin project. Seduction and eroticism, love and beauty, marriage
and fidelity are all themes to be found in Titian's painting. The role of skin
in conjuring eroticism, fertility, and femininity may seem obvious; the role of
skin in determining the relationship between these themes and more practical
issues of marriage, domesticity, and household order less so. But <i>Venus of Urbino</i> brings these ideas
together in a number of practical and material interventions. </p>

<p><br/></p>

<p>Skin has always been central to ideas about
beauty. This was true not just in the many recipes for smoothing out
complexions or those for hiding or curing freckles and blemishes, but also in the lengthy and
detailed attention paid by the new artistic manuals of the Renaissance to
representing it in paint. The art historian Mechthild Fend has recently shown
how changes in colour, technique, and technologies facilitated and shaped
medical attitudes to skin. Going forward, we will be asking questions about how
aesthetic ideas of beauty, complexion, and the surface interacted with medical ideas
about complexions, pores, and skin ailments. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Crucially, this painting is not just about
human skin but about animal skin too. Of particular note are the two
serving women in the background packing (or unpacking) the large chest (<i>cassone</i>). The woman standing has a fur garment draped over her left shoulder. Titian painted the same model [as <i>Venus</i>] with a similar fur in the
contemporary painting <i>Girl in a Fur </i>(1536-1538).
His preoccupation with representing the luxurious skin of an animal against the
naked skin of a woman throws up the division between human and animal.
Unlike cultural (and theological) assumptions about the differences between
humans and animals, Renaissance medical theory made no such distinction. A key
concern then is how Renaissance anatomists conceptualised fur, feathers, and
other sorts of animal skin. Did they think of it (like hair) as a kind of
bodily excrement? Indeed, did they think of it at all? </p>

<p> </p>

<p>In some ways then, this is a painting that
calls to mind the deepest questions about the relationship between surface and
reality, and the way in which meaning is conveyed by matter. It is not just fur
that Titian lingers on; the <i>Venus of
Urbino</i> is a veritable encyclopedia of the textiles and textures of
Renaissance materials - from the plush, draped velvets behind the reclining
nude, her braided hair (a commonplace display of artistic virtuosity), to the silky fur of the small dog, curled at her feet. There is no doubt that the painting's
meaning is enigmatic but this is precisely the point, for the tension between what
skin reveals and what it conceals is one of the most prevalent aspects of its cultural
representation. It is for this reason that skin is so often tied to the
individual, not just in art, but also in literature, poetry, drama, metaphor, and
idiom. The central thesis of our project is that the relationship between
skin and the cultural idea of the human and non-human individual has a history
- when we uncover it, what will we find?</p><p><br/></p><p>HM</p><p><br/></p><p>Image: Titian, The Venus of Urbino, 1538, Galleria degli Uffizi, Florence</p>

                      <h3>Bidloo - human skin</h3> <p>

<div class="page-content">
    
    
    <p>This plate is one of the first depictions
of human skin as seen, at least ostensibly, under a microscope. It is taken
from the 1685 <i>Anatomia
humani corporis</i><i> </i> by the Dutch anatomist and
physician, Govard Bidloo (1649-1713). The image was drawn by Gerard de Lairesse and engraved by Pieter van Gunst. It is one of 105 engraved plates to be included in Bidloo's work. It was reproduced in
William Cowper's translation, <i>The Anatomy
of Humane Bodies</i> (Oxford, 1698).</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Bidloo was particularly meticulous in annotating the image,
which included the cuticula (figs.1-4), the general external surface (figs.5-6), six
strands of hair (figs.7-12), fat (fig. 13), and the internal 'common membrane' (figs.14-15). The fingerprint (fig.4) is the most recognisable part of the image and has sometimes
been described as being the origin of forensic science. In writing about skin, Bidloo's greatest contribution was to
describe skin as being composed of many strata (or layers), the number of which varied according to the areas of the body on which it was found. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Bidloo participated in an
anatomical discourse that was traditionally associated with the seventeenth-century popularisation of the microscope. From the 1650s onwards, microscopists such as
Robert Hooke, Antony van Leeuwenhoek, Marcello Malpighi, and many others examined
skin carefully and made a number of significant observations about its pigmentation and
composition. Some of these new insights departed from the traditional explanations provided
by classical sources or the primarily functional ones that had been offered earlier in the century by commentators such as Girolamo Mercuriale. While these texts linked skin
to disease, microscopists investigated its anatomy. Writers such as Bidloo were
particularly interested in the permeability and porousness of the body, with
debate raging over the nature of pores, the function and location of sweat
glands, perspiration, and the role of the skin in transporting fluids. The earliest microscopists included descriptions of skin in their writing, but it was not until Lairesse's drawings that these changing concepts of skin were
depicted visually. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>On the one hand, then, Bidloo's
illustration provides remarkable evidence for the role of microscopy in
discovering and cataloging new medical knowledge about skin. However, on the
other hand, it also indicates the prolonged and critical role of the
imagination. It is not clear whether Lairesse would have actually ever seen the microscopic
samples about which Bidloo wrote. Indeed, many seventeenth-century anatomical
illustrators relied heavily on the descriptions provided by anatomists for rendering their drawings. Adhering to standard anatomical conventions, particularly relating to the display
of insects and animals, the samples of skin are shown tacked to the
surface of the page with pins. Given the size of such microscopic fragments,
this would have been impossible! While it is clear that the microscope caused
many evidentiary problems which stimulated sustained scientific attention, the
solution could sometimes be aesthetic. It is an important aim of the project to
examine the relationship between these various impulses for new knowledge, as
well as whether knowledge deemed to be an important 'discovery', such as
Bidloo's fingerprint, really was influential in altering medical thinking.</p><p><br/></p><p>HM</p><p><br/></p><p>Image taken from Govard Bidloo, <i>Anatomia humani corporis</i> (1685) with contributions from Gerard de Lairesse (1640-1711), illustrator; Abraham Blooteling (1640-1690), engraver; and Pieter Stevens van Gunst (1659?-1724?), engraver.

<div class="page-content">
    
    
    <p>This plate is one of the first depictions
of human skin as seen, at least ostensibly, under a microscope. It is taken
from the 1685 <i>Anatomia
humani corporis</i><i> </i> by the Dutch anatomist and
physician, Govard Bidloo (1649-1713). The image was drawn by Gerard de Lairesse and engraved by Pieter van Gunst. It is one of 105 engraved plates to be included in Bidloo's work. It was reproduced in
William Cowper's translation, <i>The Anatomy
of Humane Bodies</i> (Oxford, 1698).</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Bidloo was particularly meticulous in annotating the image,
which included the cuticula (figs.1-4), the general external surface (figs.5-6), six
strands of hair (figs.7-12), fat (fig. 13), and the internal 'common membrane' (figs.14-15). The fingerprint (fig.4) is the most recognisable part of the image and has sometimes
been described as being the origin of forensic science. In writing about skin, Bidloo's greatest contribution was to

                      <h3>Andrew Snape&#x27;s Composition of a Horse</h3> <p>

<div class="page-content">
    
    
    <p>Andrew Snape, serjeant farrier to Charles II, wrote
the first text in English on equine anatomy, dedicating it to his royal patron.
<i>The Anatomy of an Horse </i>was published in London in 1683. Most of the engravings in Snape’s book are copied from Carlo Ruini’s monumental <i>Anatomia del
cauallo, infermità, et suoi rimedii</i> (1598), which itself resembles an equine version of the famous human anatomical text <i>De humani corporis fabrica</i> (1543) by Vesalius, with
flayed horses replacing
Vesalius’s skinless men.</p><p><br/></p><p></p>

<p>Ruini did not address the composition of
equine skin, starting instead from the muscles and then moving inwards to cover the nerves, the organs, and other parts of a horse’s body. Skin is only
discussed in the chapters that deal with diseases, such as<i> lepra</i> and scabies, rather than in regard to anatomy. This approach is similar to other writings on the care of a horse, in which skin usually only appears in the context of skin afflictions. The exception to this would be in a discussion on the different colours of horses, often due to
humoreal temperament. In contrast, Snape's discourse truly does work from the outside in, with his very first chapter on hair. Before he even approaches the common membrane of the muscles, there are a number of layers - the scarf-skin, the true skin, the
fleshy pannicle, and the fat.</p><p><br/></p>

<p>The hairs of a horse were not considered strictly a
part of the body, being 'ingendred of a clammy and earthy Excrement of the
third concoction' - a by-product of digestion. This humoreal waste is thrust up
through the pores of the skin; some of it enters the roots of the hairs, but the
more ‘earthly’ waste is 'driven out amongst the hair where it becomes dust;
which dust is that that is brought forth with the Curry-combe when a Horse is
drest'. According to Snape, despite all the grooming in the world, a horse
will always be covered in new ‘dust’ the next day. In fact, copious cleaning was believed to engender even more ‘dust’, for the cleaner the horse, the more open its
pores. This allowed for more waste to be excreted easily through the
pores of the skin. Horses that were not groomed regularly would likely lose their
hair, as their pores would be blocked, preventing the ‘dust’ from being removed.</p><p><br/></p>

<p>The 'cuticle' or 'scarf-skin' was the outer layer of
skin and protected the horse’s body from external injuries. So if an ill-fitting saddle rubbed against the horse, removing only the
scarf-skin, the horse would have no long-lasting scars for this layer of skin
could grow back easily. By contrast, if a saddle were to pull off parts of the layer of ‘true skin’, blemishes or scars would remain. This was as a result of the ‘true skin’ having a spermetical origin in the early development of the
equine embryo and, as such, could not repair itself. </p><p><br/></p>

<p>Due to a lack of veins, arteries, and nerves, the 'scarf-skin' was considered to be insensible in
itself. Snape explained that if you were to only spur the 'scarf-skin', the horse would neither move
nor bleed, both of which it would do if your spurs were to reach the layer of 'true skin'. The 'scarf-skin' was covered with pores that allowed transpiration (both sweat and 'insensible transpiration') out of the body. These pores could be obstructed by
cold air after a vigorous ride, giving the horse cold water to drink, or washing
its body in cold water when hot. With these pores closed, these vapours
would be trapped between the two layers of skin and 'generate evill Distempers'. The true skin or cutis that lay below the 'scarf-skin' had the same pores. Like the 'scarf-skin', the true skin protected the body but it also held in the body's spirits and natural heat 'as in a Castle'.
Without the true skin, these elements would depart the body in hot weather or excessive
exercise, leaving 'the vital parts destitute, which would occasion the loss of
your Beast'.</p><p><br/></p><p>Underneath the true skin lay the flesh pannicle.
Unlike in a human body, in which this membrane was said to be located below the fat, in horses it
was said to be above the layer of fat. The pannicle was flesh-like in some parts of the body
and membranous in others. Snape recommended care when flaying a horse as this
pannicle could be removed easily along with the skin. It helped the muscles to move
the skin 'whereby the Beast shakes off the Flies, or any other thing that
offends him', defended internal parts, and prevented fat from 'being melted and
spent by the continual motion of the Muscles'. If a horse had a wound that
reached down to the true-skin layer, this membrane would help 'glew as it were the
sides of it together again' and create a scar. Below this membrane lay
the fat, which was 'like a Garment, to keep the Body warm' and protected the
horse from blows or similar injuries.</p>

                      <h3>Mercuriale and Skin</h3> <p>

<div class="page-content">
    
    
    <p>Girolamo Mercuriale was the leading physician
teaching medicine in Northern Italy in the second half of the sixteenth century.
Born in Forlì in 1520, he graduated in philosophy and medicine in Venice in
1555. He taught at the universities of Padua (1569-1587), Bologna (1587-1592), and lastly Pisa (1593-1606), where he was also physician to the family of Ferdinando I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany.</p><p><br/></p><p>Mercuriale was a prime exemplar of medical humanism, which flourished from the
late fifteenth to the mid-seventeenth centuries. Authors would combine a
careful study of the medical works of classical writers with a description of
the conditions that the physician had observed first-hand. The emergence in the sixteenth century of new editions of classical authors,
such as those of Galen in Greek that first appeared in 1525 along with
the availability of the Hippocratic Corpus in a Latin translation, proved to be highly influential. Much emphasis was placed on understanding the exact meaning of the words used by ancient
authors, along with attempting to write in a stylistically ‘pure Latin’.
Correct nomenclature and citing the opinions of the ancients appear throughout Mercuriale’s works, although he would provide his own explanations or observations. He would also often attempt to explain the differing opinions among the ancients, for example
between Galen and Aristotle. Mercuriale did not restrict himself to classical
authors - Galen, Aristotle, Theophrastus, Pliny the Elder, and others - but included within these ‘ancient authorities’ Byzantine and Arabic authors such
as Avicenna, Avenzoar, and Paul of Aegina. In addition to writing medical texts, such as <i>Artis gymnasticae apud antiquos celeberrimae</i> (1569), Mercuriale’s 'authorship' is also
ascribed to edited works collated by students from notes taken at his
lectures.</p><p><br/></p><p>The two texts of most significant interest for the Renaissance Skin project fall under this latter category (download contents below). First published in Venice in 1572, <i>De morbis cutaneis, et omnibus corporis humani
excrementis </i>(<i>On Diseases of the
Skin and All of the Excrements of the Human Body</i>) was compiled by Paolo Aicardi. This text covers afflictions that
affected the hair and skin of the entire body, along with humoral excrements (urine, tears, spit, etc.). <i>De decoratione</i> (<i>On Adornment</i>) was published in 1585 from lecture notes compiled
by Giulio Mancini (1559-1630). It focuses on skin ailments that affect the face and the hands,
and detract from beauty.</p><p><br/></p><p>Beauty was considered to be a legitimate medical aim,
as a beautiful face was a healthy face and denoted a balanced humoral
complexion. Of the four humoral temperaments (sanguine, choleric, phlegmatic, and melancholic), sanguine was considered to be the ideal, with its beautiful mixture
of white skin and rosy cheeks. For Mercuriale, the best type of facial skin was
one that was ‘unified, equal, polished, and smooth’. <i>De decoratione</i> covers issues ranging from hair care, sun spots on
the hands, pimples, wrinkles (see image), obesity, scars, bruises, warts, and hangnails, all of which detract from the patient’s beauty. Most chapters open with a
discourse on the Greek and Latin terminology (often adding what the skin
affliction is called in Italian), followed by a long discussion on how the
ancient authors understood the origin and development of the affliction. Mercuriale then offers an explanation for treatment. In keeping with humoral medical
theory, and unlike the wholly topical remedies which appear in recipe books, Mercuriale always recommends a holistic cure, since these afflictions to beauty were most
often caused by a humoral imbalance. He might suggest a regimen of health that takes into account the patient’s food and lifestyle. Blood may be let and the
body could be purged with a variety of emetics. Only once the ill humours are purged would the physician apply topical remedies to the skin itself, in the form of unguents or baths. These topical treatments derived both from the ancients and Mercuriale himself. He sometimes notes successful (and unsuccessful) remedies used by contemporaries. And so, he warns of the
dangers for those women who apply alum or mercury water to remove wrinkles from their
faces and chests.</p><p><br/></p>

body, <i>De decoratione</i> offers a comprehensive overview of learned medical opinion on
beautifying the skin and how its ‘defects’ may be understood and cured.</p><p><br/></p><p>Download contents for Mercuriale's key texts:</p><p></p>

<div class="page-content">
    
    
    <p>Girolamo Mercuriale was the leading physician
teaching medicine in Northern Italy in the second half of the sixteenth century.
Born in Forlì in 1520, he graduated in philosophy and medicine in Venice in
1555. He taught at the universities of Padua (1569-1587), Bologna (1587-1592), and lastly Pisa (1593-1606), where he was also physician to the family of Ferdinando I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany.</p><p><br/></p><p>Mercuriale was a prime exemplar of medical humanism, which flourished from the
late fifteenth to the mid-seventeenth centuries. Authors would combine a
careful study of the medical works of classical writers with a description of
the conditions that the physician had observed first-hand. The emergence in the sixteenth century of new editions of classical authors,
such as those of Galen in Greek that first appeared in 1525 along with
the availability of the Hippocratic Corpus in a Latin translation, proved to be highly influential. Much emphasis was placed on understanding the exact meaning of the words used by ancient
authors, along with attempting to write in a stylistically ‘pure Latin’.
Correct nomenclature and citing the opinions of the ancients appear throughout Mercuriale’s works, although he would provide his own explanations or observations. He would also often attempt to explain the differing opinions among the ancients, for example
between Galen and Aristotle. Mercuriale did not restrict himself to classical
authors - Galen, Aristotle, Theophrastus, Pliny the Elder, and others - but included within these ‘ancient authorities’ Byzantine and Arabic authors such
as Avicenna, Avenzoar, and Paul of Aegina. In addition to writing medical texts, such as <i>Artis gymnasticae apud antiquos celeberrimae</i> (1569), Mercuriale’s 'authorship' is also
ascribed to edited works collated by students from notes taken at his
lectures.</p><p><br/></p><p>The two texts of most significant interest for the Renaissance Skin project fall under this latter category (download contents below). First published in Venice in 1572, <i>De morbis cutaneis, et omnibus corporis humani
excrementis </i>(<i>On Diseases of the
Skin and All of the Excrements of the Human Body</i>) was compiled by Paolo Aicardi. This text covers afflictions that
affected the hair and skin of the entire body, along with humoral excrements (urine, tears, spit, etc.). <i>De decoratione</i> (<i>On Adornment</i>) was published in 1585 from lecture notes compiled
by Giulio Mancini (1559-1630). It focuses on skin ailments that affect the face and the hands,
and detract from beauty.</p><p><br/></p><p>Beauty was considered to be a legitimate medical aim,
as a beautiful face was a healthy face and denoted a balanced humoral
complexion. Of the four humoral temperaments (sanguine, choleric, phlegmatic, and melancholic), sanguine was considered to be the ideal, with its beautiful mixture
of white skin and rosy cheeks. For Mercuriale, the best type of facial skin was
one that was ‘unified, equal, polished, and smooth’. <i>De decoratione</i> covers issues ranging from hair care, sun spots on
the hands, pimples, wrinkles (see image), obesity, scars, bruises, warts, and hangnails, all of which detract from the patient’s beauty. Most chapters open with a
discourse on the Greek and Latin terminology (often adding what the skin
affliction is called in Italian), followed by a long discussion on how the
ancient authors understood the origin and development of the affliction. Mercuriale then offers an explanation for treatment. In keeping with humoral medical
theory, and unlike the wholly topical remedies which appear in recipe books, Mercuriale always recommends a holistic cure, since these afflictions to beauty were most
often caused by a humoral imbalance. He might suggest a regimen of health that takes into account the patient’s food and lifestyle. Blood may be let and the
body could be purged with a variety of emetics. Only once the ill humours are purged would the physician apply topical remedies to the skin itself, in the form of unguents or baths. These topical treatments derived both from the ancients and Mercuriale himself. He sometimes notes successful (and unsuccessful) remedies used by contemporaries. And so, he warns of the
dangers for those women who apply alum or mercury water to remove wrinkles from their
faces and chests.</p><p><br/></p>

<p><i>De
decoratione</i> is not the only scholarly medical work on beauty written within a
humanist framework. Other similar works include Gabriele Falloppio’s <i>Opuscula
tria. De decoratione</i> (Padua, 1566) and Giovanni Tommaso Minadoi’s <i>De humani corporis turpitudinibus cognoscendis &amp; curandis</i> (<i>On
understanding and curing the ugliness of the human body</i>) (Padua, 1600). But Mercuriale's text remains the most extensive of these works, particularly in regard to defects of facial beauty. When combined with his work on skin afflictions that affect the entire
body, <i>De decoratione</i> offers a comprehensive overview of learned medical opinion on
beautifying the skin and how its ‘defects’ may be understood and cured.</p><p><br/></p><p>Download contents for Mercuriale's key texts:</p><p></p>

                      <h3>Skin and Touch</h3> <p>

<div class="page-content">
    
    
    <p>In his <i>Pentaestheseion</i>
(1609), Giulio Cesare Casseri, professor of anatomy in Padua, claimed that
touch was the most important of the senses and a model for the other four.
The image on the left describes in detail the hands and feet, the skin on which Casseri identified the 'seat' of touch, the place where touch was localised in a single place on the body. Casseri distinguished between <em>cutis</em>
and <em>cuticula</em> – the real skin and the most external or superficial
layer, respectively. With numerous nerve endings at the <i>cutis</i>, Casseri showed how this was the seat of touch.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Before the systematic use of microscopes, anatomists
and physicians adopted collectively a subversion of Aristotle
in their descriptions of the relationships between skin and touch. For
Aristotle, skin originated from the drying out of the flesh. It was a
specific kind of flesh that could not evaporate, and thus it hardened and remained
on the surface of the body [see entry on <a href="../living/cheese-and-skin/index.html">Cheese and Skin</a>]. Aristotle saw the skin as formed of two layers: one external and one internal. Importantly, then, he considered the skin to be <em>sine
sensu</em>, with the seat of sensation and touch located in the flesh under the skin.
Galenic writings oscillate on this point, but Galen’s anatomical writings acknowledge that the warmness of the skin is balanced out by the coldness of the nerves that
terminate there. Skin itself was capable of feeling.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>This issue of the seat of touch concerned the Arabic and
Latin Middle Ages and continued to spark interest for sixteenth-century anatomists. The most famous anatomists of the century, even when they addressed the skin in only marginal
notes or brief chapters within their works, did nevertheless prove Aristotle wrong. For they all knew
that the philosopher was not able to see that the nerves ended in the <em>cutis</em>.
While in 1502 Alessandro Benedetti, humanist and anatomist in Padua, still
claimed that the <i>cutis </i>was <em>sine sensu</em>, figures like Vesalius,
Valverde, Colombo, and Falloppio described nervous structures linking the <i>cutis</i> to the brain. Before Casseri and
his proto-microscopic images, the most explicit anatomists in relation to this issue were the
Basel-based Felix Platter and Caspar Bauhin, who both described the skin as the primary seat of the sense of touch.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>In the age of the microscope, it was Marcello Malpighi
who demonstrated the tactile strcutures of the skin in a curiously brief and
image-less 'observation' published in 1665 and entitled <em>De externo tactu
organo anatomica</em> <i>observation</i> [see entry on<b> </b><a href="bidloo/index.html">Bidloo</a>]. This booklet followed
his discoveries of the papillae on the tongue (taste buds), which were
stimulated by little food particles. It was a discovery clearly influenced,
via Galileo, by a kind of revival of Epicurean-Lucretian atomism. In 1665, Malpighi
examined the organ of touch <i>par excellence</i>, the human hand: he
detached the external layer (<i>cuticula</i>) with a hot iron and observed a
network-like surface on which he described seeing not only the sudoriferous vessels, but
also countless pyramid-shaped papillae. The organs of touch, he said, were
precisely these papillae.</p>

    <p><br/></p><p>Interestingly enough, Malpighi wrote that these
papillae behaved like a blind man with his stick, who touched anything in his immediate
surroundings before recognising the shape of the objects. In his <em>Dioptrique</em> (1637) Renée Descartes had used the same image of a blind man with
his stick, for quite the opposite purpose. Descartes argued there that sight
was the most noble of the senses, and that images of things were indeed innate
in the human mind. But when he had to explain what was light – which according
to him was a kind of motion or action that moved through the air and 'touched' the eye – Descartes used the analogy of the blind man who used his stick
so that he almost saw the world through his hands.</p>

touch explained sight via human skin.</p><p><br/></p><p>PS</p><p><br/></p><p>Further Reading:</p><p></p><ul><li>Domenico Bertoloni Meli, <i>Mechanism, Experiment, Disease: Marcello Malpighi and

    <p>The first treatise on surgery to be printed in New Spain was the <i>Summa y Recopilación de Cirugía</i> by Alonzo López de Hinojosos. He was a <i>romancista </i>surgeon, a term used to denote a medical professional who was not
university trained but could demonstrate that he had worked for
four years in a hospital or city in the presence of an approved surgeon. This did not necessarily mean that such surgeons were unlearned, but rather that they had been examined in Spanish and not in Latin. López de Hinojosos read
and quoted texts that had been written either in the vernacular, such those by
Luis Lobbera de Ávila and Juan Fragoso, or translated into Spanish, such as
those by the fourteenth-century French surgeon Guy de Chauliac or the early
modern Italian surgeon Giovanni da Vigo. References are also made to the
ancients, such as Galen and Celsus. It seems that López de Hinojosos may have had access to the work of the Greek physician Pedanius Dioscorides, which had been recently translated into Spanish. For it is likely that López de Hinojosos used Dioscorides for the section on medicines ('antidotary') that appeared in
the second edition of his book.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>After arriving in New Spain in the early 1570s, López de Hinojosos
worked in hospitals in Mexico City, first in the Hospital de la Concepción
de Nuestra Señora before spending fourteen years at the Hospital Real de
San José.
At the latter, he was employed both as a surgeon and as a
<i>majordomo</i>, or administrator. It was at this hospital (also called the Hospital
Real de Indios) where he wrote the first edition of his text on surgery. He was
admitted to the Society of Jesus in 1585, dying in 1595.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>His surgical text was conceived to reach a lay audience, people who might
reside 'outside of this city, in mines, farms, villages, and remote places, who
lack convenient remedies'. Similarly, other medical texts published in New Spain, such as Agustín
Farfán’s <i>Tratado Breve de Medicina</i>
(1579) and Juan de Esteynefer’s <i>Florilegio
Medicina</i> (1712), also attempted to serve as a guide for those lacking access to medical professionals and non-learned professionals. These works combined humoral medicine with remedies using
both Old and New World flora and fauna.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>López de Hinojosos’s 1578 edition (c. 400 pages in octavo format) was
titled <i>Summary and compilation of
surgery with a very useful and helpful art for bloodletting</i>. It was divided
into seven treatises, consisting of: on anatomy and the different parts of the
body (17 chapters); on bloodletting (7 chapters); on abscesses (27 chapters); on fresh wounds (13 chapters); on the evil of the buboes [syphilis] (5
chapters); on fractures or dislocations (12 chapters); and finishing with a
treatise on pestilence. This last section discusses <i>cocoliztli</i>, a devastating epidemic disease that took hold in Mexico City in 1576.
This was the second outbreak of <i>cocoliztli
</i>to affect New Spain in the sixteenth century. Recently, this epidemic has been identified tentatively as an enteric fever caused by a strain of <i>salmonella enterica</i> bacterium.</p>

López de Hinojosos followed the division of skin into the dermis (or cutis) and the cuticle (outermost layer of skin), with the terms ‘true’ and ‘untrue’ skin. The 'true' skin resided under the ‘untrue’ skin, which was a thin layer to protect against extreme temperatures. López de Hinojosos also explains that this 'untrue' skin was a necessary intermediary layer between the 'true' skin and the object with which you have contact, to ensure the correct sensation of touch.</p>

It should be noted that there is true skin and non-true skin. Nature has thus ordained it because if an object is close to the sense of touch, the object will overwhelm the sense of touch.

                      <h3>Skin Ailments in the Thesaurus Pauperum</h3> <p>

<div class="page-content">
    
    
    <p>The <i>Thesaurus pauperum</i>, a medical
text designed for a non-specialist readership, circulated widely in the late
medieval and early modern period. The text survives in over 70 manuscripts, with many more extant printed copies in Latin (first printed in
Antwerp in 1476) and in various vernacular languages. The Italian <i>Tesoro de poveri </i>was first printed in 1492
in Florence, and then later in Venice. In English, it was known as <i>The treasurie of healthe</i> and was first published in London in 1550, while the Catalan version was called the <i>Tresor
de pobres</i>. The work was also translated into German and Portuguese.</p><p><br/></p><p>The author ascribed to the text is one ‘Peter of Spain’, a name associated
with the noted 13th-century Aristotelian scholar of the same designation and
also with Pope John XXI. In spite of this, the author still remains to be definitively identified. As was befitting of an accessible, everyday, and relatively
inexpensive text, the book usually appeared in a small format, such as octavo.</p><p><br/></p>

<p>Over time, the text grew in size: many medieval manuscript versions have 55 chapters; while some 16th-century printed editions have more than 100 chapters, covering everything from liver pain to
tooth powder recipes. It seems that both transcribers and translators were often unable to resist adding extra chapters. We see at times that these additional
chapters go far beyond the stated remit of the text to address ailments of the human body, from head to toe. For example the Spanish version ends with short chapters
covering matters such as how to remove the skin from nuts, getting rid of fleas
from a house (recommending the smoke from burning leeches to achieve this), or the scrofulous
swellings of the lymph nodes of a horse (involving placing a man or woman's washcloth in the horse’s drinking water). These additions are
usually short and lack the citation of authors that are mentioned so copiously
in entries from the ‘core’ text, such
as Constantine the African, Avicenna, or Gilbert the Englishman.</p><p><br/></p>

<p>The Spanish version (<i>Libro de
medicina llamado Tesoro de los pobres</i>) was printed many times in the
sixteenth century in Seville, Zaragoza, and Valladolid, and was usually
accompanied by a regimen of health ascribed erroneously to the famed 13th-century physician Arnau de Vilanova. It continued to be published in various editions and in various
locations throughout the early modern period; examples are known from the eighteenth century, such as in Barcelona in 1750 and in Madrid in 1762. This text is of
particular interest within the context of examining skin afflictions in early modern Spanish medical texts that were designed
for either non-learned medical practitioners or a lay readership. These texts include Bartolomo Hidalgo de Agüero, <i>Thesoro de la
verdadera cirug</i><i>ía </i>(Seville, 1610), Alonzo López de Hinojosos, <a href="skin-and-surgery-alonzo-lópez-de-hinojosos/index.html">Summa y Recopilación de Cirugía</a> (Mexico, 1579),
Agustín Farfán, <i>Tratado Brebe de
Chirurgia y del conocimiento y cura de algunas enfermedades</i> (México, 1579),
and Juan de Esteyneffer, <i>Florilegio
medicinal</i> (Mexico, 1712). The <i>Tesoro de los pobres </i>was also cited in other medical
treatises intended for a broad circulation or for readers with little access to
medical expertise. The 18th-century <i>Tratado breve de medicina </i>by the Jesuit Sigismund Aperger was designed to be a basic medical handbook for those
practising in the missions of Paraguay and Río de la Plata. It is replete with material
taken from the <i>Tesoro de los pobres</i>.</p><p><br/></p>

usually short and lack the citation of authors that are mentioned so copiously
in entries from the ‘core’ text, such
as Constantine the African, Avicenna, or Gilbert the Englishman.</p><p><br/></p>

<p>The Spanish version (<i>Libro de
medicina llamado Tesoro de los pobres</i>) was printed many times in the
sixteenth century in Seville, Zaragoza, and Valladolid, and was usually
accompanied by a regimen of health ascribed erroneously to the famed 13th-century physician Arnau de Vilanova. It continued to be published in various editions and in various
locations throughout the early modern period; examples are known from the eighteenth century, such as in Barcelona in 1750 and in Madrid in 1762. This text is of
particular interest within the context of examining skin afflictions in early modern Spanish medical texts that were designed
for either non-learned medical practitioners or a lay readership. These texts include Bartolomo Hidalgo de Agüero, <i>Thesoro de la
verdadera cirug</i><i>ía </i>(Seville, 1610), Alonzo López de Hinojosos, <a href="skin-and-surgery-alonzo-lópez-de-hinojosos/index.html">Summa y Recopilación de Cirugía</a> (Mexico, 1579),
Agustín Farfán, <i>Tratado Brebe de
Chirurgia y del conocimiento y cura de algunas enfermedades</i> (México, 1579),
and Juan de Esteyneffer, <i>Florilegio
medicinal</i> (Mexico, 1712). The <i>Tesoro de los pobres </i>was also cited in other medical
treatises intended for a broad circulation or for readers with little access to
medical expertise. The 18th-century <i>Tratado breve de medicina </i>by the Jesuit Sigismund Aperger was designed to be a basic medical handbook for those
practising in the missions of Paraguay and Río de la Plata. It is replete with material
taken from the <i>Tesoro de los pobres</i>.</p><p><br/></p>

                      <h3>Pangolins - classifying &#x27;scaly lizards&#x27;</h3> <p>

<div class="page-content">
    
    
    <p>In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, many new and exotic natural objects arrived
in Europe from distant lands. Most were barely more than tokens of the creatures and plants from which
they had been sourced. Among these were
the strange scaly skins of 'lizards' brought from the 'Indies'.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>These were in fact the skins of pangolins, or scaly
anteaters. There are eight extant species, four in Asia and four in Africa.
Most people today will have never heard of a pangolin, but recent media
attention has brought them to the fore, as their conservation
status remains precarious: several are on the brink of extinction. Their striking scales that made
them so intriguing to 17th-century naturalists are also what make them
the most traded mammal on the planet. Unfortunately, they are valued in traditional
Chinese and Vietnamese 'medicines'.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Unlike many other exotic natural objects in the
seventeenth century, pangolin specimens were easily preserved and transported
to Europe from Asia and Africa, so they were not uncommon in curiosity cabinets.
Along with specimens such as narwhal teeth and bird-of-paradise skins,
pangolins seem to have been part of the requisite set of 'things' making up any
cabinet of status, such as those of Ulysse Aldrovandi in Bologna, Manfredo
Settala's museum in Milan, and the Royal Society collection. These scaled objects lacked a specific
geographical identity - they were initially just considered as exotic things from the 'Indies'. Authors
likened these specimens to other inanimate objects in collections, such as ivory scales,
small caskets, shells, pine cones, and even an artichoke.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>These scaly, carapaced beasts posed a
problem for naturalists: where should they be placed in the wider scheme of
nature? The heirarchical Great Chain of Being was the traditional structure
that ordered all of Creation. Fish, reptiles (scaly, cold-blooded, oviparous), and
invertebrates were somewhere near the bottom, whilst mammals (furry,
warm-blooded, live-bearing quadrupeds) and birds were higher in the Chain, all
joined by infinite linking forms. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Were the scaly-backed, furry-bellied pangolins
reptiles or mammals? It seemed they were somewhere in between, so naturalists
depicted them as liminal beasts on the border of these two categories. In
amongst descriptions of various lizards in his <i>Historiae animalium </i>(1554), the Swiss naturalist Conrad Gessner had
described 'animals similar to serpents' in 'Oriental India' with four feet and
very long tails. In <i>De quadrupedibus
digitatis </i>(1645)<i>, </i>the Bolognese
collector Ulysse Aldrovandi included a woodcut of his own scaly <i>Lacertus Indicus</i> ('Indian lizard')
specimen among the exotic lizards, describing it as a 'congener of the <i>Iguana</i>' (see main image).<i>  </i></p>

<p><i> </i></p>

<p>Similarly, the apothecary Albertus Seba's luxurious
collection catalogue pictured one pangolin extruding its long 'reptilian'
tongue (see left-hand image) and another in the company of several snakes (see right-hand image).<i> </i>Pangolins were also included
among reptiles in many other catalogues and works of taxonomy. For example,
in the <i>Synopsis animalium quadrupedum </i>(1693) by the English naturalist John Ray, the <i>lacertus
peregrinus </i>('foreign lizard') was classified alongside the egg-laying
reptiles or 'oviparous quadrupeds', 'on account of its form'.</p><p></p>

                              <h3>Pangolins - classifying &#x27;scaly lizards&#x27;</h3> 

<div class="page-content">
    
    
    <p>In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, many new and exotic natural objects arrived
in Europe from distant lands. Most were barely more than tokens of the creatures and plants from which
they had been sourced. Among these were
the strange scaly skins of 'lizards' brought from the 'Indies'.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>These were in fact the skins of pangolins, or scaly
anteaters. There are eight extant species, four in Asia and four in Africa.
Most people today will have never heard of a pangolin, but recent media
attention has brought them to the fore, as their conservation
status remains precarious: several are on the brink of extinction. Their striking scales that made
them so intriguing to 17th-century naturalists are also what make them
the most traded mammal on the planet. Unfortunately, they are valued in traditional
Chinese and Vietnamese 'medicines'.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Unlike many other exotic natural objects in the
seventeenth century, pangolin specimens were easily preserved and transported
to Europe from Asia and Africa, so they were not uncommon in curiosity cabinets.
Along with specimens such as narwhal teeth and bird-of-paradise skins,
pangolins seem to have been part of the requisite set of 'things' making up any
cabinet of status, such as those of Ulysse Aldrovandi in Bologna, Manfredo
Settala's museum in Milan, and the Royal Society collection. These scaled objects lacked a specific
geographical identity - they were initially just considered as exotic things from the 'Indies'. Authors
likened these specimens to other inanimate objects in collections, such as ivory scales,
small caskets, shells, pine cones, and even an artichoke.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>These scaly, carapaced beasts posed a
problem for naturalists: where should they be placed in the wider scheme of
nature? The heirarchical Great Chain of Being was the traditional structure
that ordered all of Creation. Fish, reptiles (scaly, cold-blooded, oviparous), and
invertebrates were somewhere near the bottom, whilst mammals (furry,
warm-blooded, live-bearing quadrupeds) and birds were higher in the Chain, all
joined by infinite linking forms. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Were the scaly-backed, furry-bellied pangolins
reptiles or mammals? It seemed they were somewhere in between, so naturalists
depicted them as liminal beasts on the border of these two categories. In
amongst descriptions of various lizards in his <i>Historiae animalium </i>(1554), the Swiss naturalist Conrad Gessner had
described 'animals similar to serpents' in 'Oriental India' with four feet and
very long tails. In <i>De quadrupedibus
digitatis </i>(1645)<i>, </i>the Bolognese
collector Ulysse Aldrovandi included a woodcut of his own scaly <i>Lacertus Indicus</i> ('Indian lizard')
specimen among the exotic lizards, describing it as a 'congener of the <i>Iguana</i>' (see main image).<i>  </i></p>

<p><i> </i></p>

<p>Similarly, the apothecary Albertus Seba's luxurious
collection catalogue pictured one pangolin extruding its long 'reptilian'
tongue (see left-hand image) and another in the company of several snakes (see right-hand image).<i> </i>Pangolins were also included
among reptiles in many other catalogues and works of taxonomy. For example,
in the <i>Synopsis animalium quadrupedum </i>(1693) by the English naturalist John Ray, the <i>lacertus
peregrinus </i>('foreign lizard') was classified alongside the egg-laying
reptiles or 'oviparous quadrupeds', 'on account of its form'.</p><p></p>

                      <h3>Martín Arredondo and the perfect horse</h3> <p>

<div class="page-content">
    
    
    <p>Martín Arredondo’s <i>Obras de Albeytería</i> (<i>Veterinary Works</i>) is arguably the most
important work on equine medical care in 17th-century Spain. Describing himself
in the book as a ‘master of shoeing, veterinary care and surgeon, a gentleman
in the Old Royal Guards of Castille’ (‘maestro de Herrador, Albeytar, y
Cirujano, Gentil-Hombre en las Reales Guardas Viejas de Castilla’), Arredondo
published the text in successive stages.</p>

<p><br/></p>

<p>The first part, <i>Recopilación de Albeytería, sacada de varios
autores </i>(<i>Veterinary compilation, from
various authors</i>) was published in Madrid in 1658. The second volume was
published separately in 1661, also in Madrid, under the title <i>Tratado segundo. Flores de Albeytería.
Sacada de various autores</i> (<i>Second
treatise. The flowers of veterinary care. From various authors</i>). Both
volumes appeared together in 1669 under the title<i> Obras de Albeyteria. Prima, segunda, y tercera parte. Ahora nuevamente
corregidas y añadidas </i>(<i>Veterinary
works. First, second, and third part. Now newly corrected with additions</i>). The
first part of this compilation corresponds to the <i>Recopilación</i>, while the second part repeats much from the first
part though with additional material, and the third part is an extended version
of <i>Flores de Albeytería</i>.</p>

<p><br/></p>

<p>The text was republished
numerous times in Madrid – 1677, 1705, 1723, and 1728 – and in Zaragoza – 1704
and 1706. Many sections of the <i>Obras de
Albeytería </i>are relevant to skin, with detailed instructions for
bloodletting and the description and treatment of assorted skin ailments. The relevant
chapters from Book One follow.</p><p></p><ul><li>Ch. 2: Trata de las

chapter 11. Within chapter 15 are recipes for: 'Polvos para cicatrizar' (powders

                      <h3>A Passion for Beards</h3> <p>

<div class="page-content">
    
    
    <p>Beards were one of the most important facial signs of upper-class
masculinity in sixteenth-century Europe, and contemporary portraits show men
displaying beards in a wide variety of styles and shapes. Beards were commented
upon by humanists, physicians, barbers, physiognomers, and in books of secrets.
Giovanni Battista Della Porta wrote in his <i>De
humana physiognomonia </i>(1586):</p>

<p><i><br/></i></p><p><i>Nature adorned the
jaws with hair in order to build an ornament, and not just to cover them; the
bearded man appears much more worthy of veneration. […] Hair is a sign of
virility and strength; those who have a long beard and are full of hair are
strong and brave; indeed, a chin with no hair is sign of a womanly and weak
nature, and of cowardice. </i></p>

<p><br/></p><p>Popular wisdom too
had its own traditions. A woman grew a beard as consequence of her own bad habits,
hence the proverb: ‘greet a bearded woman with stones’ (<i>femina barbuta con pietre si salute</i>). On this Della Porta noted: </p>

<p><i><br/></i></p><p><i>Bearded
women are full of life, luxurious, and men-like due to their warm complexion.
The natural cause of this that heat creates hair, therefore those parts which
are most hairy are the warmest. […] Abundant hair shows abundance of excrements
and semen. […] Atistotle confirms that women who do not menstruate have a beard
for the reasons mentioned above.</i></p>

<p><br/></p><p>Furthermore, he gave both physiological and teleological reasons why men – and men
alone – had beards: </p>

<p><i><br/></i></p><p><i>nature
made bodies according to their habits. Women do not need as many covering and
protection as men do in order to fight the cold, since they always stay indoors.
[…] All things of cold temperament are naked and glabrous. […] Women’s bodies
are glabrous for lack of heat; eunuchs are hairless for the same reason.</i></p>

<p><br/></p><p>Learned physicians
such as Gerolamo Mercuriale wrote about beards too, indulging in scientific and
Galenic causal explanations. The physiology of facial hair, however, remained
standard throughout the early modern period; a beard was understood to be a vaporous
‘superfluity’, something akin to sweat, which passed through the skin’s pores
becoming thick once it came into contact with the external environment. The density
or softness of a man’s skin was reflected in the quality of his facial hair. A
beard, therefore, was a type of cutaneous excrement, linked to the body’s
temperature, and as the product of a warm and dry temperament, it was typical
of males in their ‘virile’ stage of life - roughly between 25 and 35.</p>

<p><br/></p><p>The physiological
purposes of beards were presumed to be threefold. Firstly, hair protected the
body as a form of natural clothing. Secondly, that facial hair was in fact made
up of excrement, which needed to be expelled from the body. Finally, facial
hair was the sign of specifically male, intellectual and sexual activities. Although
hair was sited at the extremities of the body, it was believed to originate
from the same location as the reproductive glands. And as the brain was
perceived as the biggest gland, responsible for intellectual activity, it needed
a covering of hair.  Marco Antonio Olmi,
physician in Padua and Mercuriale’s pupil, composed an erudite monograph titled
<i>Physiologiae barbae humanae </i>(1600) in
which he not only discribed the physical features of beards, but also coupled beards
to brain waves. Linking facial hair to male intellect, Olmi argued that the primary cause of a beard was the rapid
movement of ‘spirits’ in the brain, and the heat of the head was thus a sign of
intense intellectual activity.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>

had an ornamental function and conferred dignity to the male face. Male
physiology may have been responsible for beards, but societal conventions and physical
actuality became inextricable. Not all beards were the same however; certain styles denoted different
social markers, and the multiple varieties of beard were attested to by the
activities of early modern barber-surgeons. Beards served
to differentiate between males, as well as separating men from boys. In

that ‘those who do not have a beard could not even be called men, since they

                              <h3>A Passion for Beards</h3> 

<div class="page-content">
    
    
    <p>Beards were one of the most important facial signs of upper-class
masculinity in sixteenth-century Europe, and contemporary portraits show men
displaying beards in a wide variety of styles and shapes. Beards were commented
upon by humanists, physicians, barbers, physiognomers, and in books of secrets.
Giovanni Battista Della Porta wrote in his <i>De
humana physiognomonia </i>(1586):</p>

<p><i><br/></i></p><p><i>Nature adorned the
jaws with hair in order to build an ornament, and not just to cover them; the
bearded man appears much more worthy of veneration. […] Hair is a sign of
virility and strength; those who have a long beard and are full of hair are
strong and brave; indeed, a chin with no hair is sign of a womanly and weak
nature, and of cowardice. </i></p>

<p><br/></p><p>Popular wisdom too
had its own traditions. A woman grew a beard as consequence of her own bad habits,
hence the proverb: ‘greet a bearded woman with stones’ (<i>femina barbuta con pietre si salute</i>). On this Della Porta noted: </p>

<p><i><br/></i></p><p><i>Bearded
women are full of life, luxurious, and men-like due to their warm complexion.
The natural cause of this that heat creates hair, therefore those parts which
are most hairy are the warmest. […] Abundant hair shows abundance of excrements
and semen. […] Atistotle confirms that women who do not menstruate have a beard
for the reasons mentioned above.</i></p>

<p><br/></p><p>Furthermore, he gave both physiological and teleological reasons why men – and men
alone – had beards: </p>

<p><i><br/></i></p><p><i>nature
made bodies according to their habits. Women do not need as many covering and
protection as men do in order to fight the cold, since they always stay indoors.
[…] All things of cold temperament are naked and glabrous. […] Women’s bodies
are glabrous for lack of heat; eunuchs are hairless for the same reason.</i></p>

<p><br/></p><p>Learned physicians
such as Gerolamo Mercuriale wrote about beards too, indulging in scientific and
Galenic causal explanations. The physiology of facial hair, however, remained
standard throughout the early modern period; a beard was understood to be a vaporous
‘superfluity’, something akin to sweat, which passed through the skin’s pores
becoming thick once it came into contact with the external environment. The density
or softness of a man’s skin was reflected in the quality of his facial hair. A
beard, therefore, was a type of cutaneous excrement, linked to the body’s
temperature, and as the product of a warm and dry temperament, it was typical
of males in their ‘virile’ stage of life - roughly between 25 and 35.</p>

<p><br/></p><p>The physiological
purposes of beards were presumed to be threefold. Firstly, hair protected the
body as a form of natural clothing. Secondly, that facial hair was in fact made
up of excrement, which needed to be expelled from the body. Finally, facial
hair was the sign of specifically male, intellectual and sexual activities. Although

                      <h3>The Barbers&#x27; Superficial Body</h3> <p>

<div class="page-content">
    
    
    <p>In the early modern
period, a process of autonomization of the skin as surface – and of surface as
access point for the knowledge and treatment of the deep body – took place.
Such a phenomeno can be grasped, among other things, by reading manuals for
barber-surgeons written by eminent members of the guild in Italy between 1584
and 1671 (the most important ones were written by Pietro Magni, Tiberio Malfi, Tarduccio
Salvi da Macerata, and Cinzio D’Amato). The view on the human body emerging
from these manuals is strikingly different both from that of Galenic-style
internal physician – a body crossed by the four humours – and from that of the
new Renaissance anatomist – made of solid organs but conceived in terms of an
architectural structure going deeper and deeper, from the skin to the muscules
to the bones veins and arteries to the nerves [fig. 1]. The barbers’ body is
marked by its superficial characateristics: the network of the veins to be
opened for bloodletting, the softenss of the skin to be cauterized, the parts
of the surface on which cupping glasses could be applied, the parts to be
anointed with special unguents, and, for the most advanced, the skin to open to
extract bullets as well as bladder stones. An entirely superficial topography
of the body.</p><p><br/></p>

<p>Here is for example the description of the veins written in the vernacular
by surgeon Tarduccio Salvi da Macerata in 1650: “The vein is a conduct, or a
vessel, round-shaped, coming from the liver: its substance is rather nervous,
little sensible, and included into the spermatic parts […] Its function is to
carry the blood which nourishes the parts of the body […] Veins have just one
tunic, which is composed by three kinds of threads: the straight ones, which
run along the length of the vein; the oblique ones, which run obliquely; and
the circular ones, which go about in circles.” Straight threads attract the
blood and other humors; oblique threads retain it, so that it does not go down
or up, more than what is needed to nourish the body; circular threads expels
unwanted humors and substances. And the feasibility of phlebotomy must be assess
by looking at and touching the surface of the body: “when the patients’ veins
are not manifest neither to sight nor to touch,” or when the veins are too
small – in this latter case leeches must be applied [fig. 2].</p><p><br/></p>

Galenic medicine and the rise of mechanistic medicine which are typically
described as central scientific developments in this period. To be clear, no
one could deny that these transformations played a part in the emergence of
skin as a specific object of practical and theoretical knowledge. Rather, we
must fully acknowledge the role played by emprical surgeons and barber-surgeons
who became experts on skin by inverting the classical path of medical knowledge
– not from the inner body to its surface as manifestation of internal humoral
imbalances, but rather from the surface to the knowledge and the treatment of
the inner body.</p><p><br/></p>

                      <h3>Skin and Material Metaphors in Sixteenth Century Texts</h3> <p>

<div class="page-content">
    
    
    <p>One of the texts
our project most frequently cites is Girolame Mercuriale's De morbis cutaneis, <a href="mercuriale-and-skin/index.html">On
Diseases of the Skin</a>. De morbo cutaneis was the first printed tract
on skin disease and in it Mercuriale writes that: "The Skin, all
physicians apparently agree, has been placed about the bodies of animals as a
protective covering for the flesh and members. Hippocrates in his book on bones
seems to have said that it is a binding for the body parts, which, being
individually separate, require a common bond, and this is the skin. Thus the
divine Plato rightly likened the skin to a fisherman’s net, as Galen did
also." In comparing skin to a fisherman's net, Mercuriale was referring to
the porous quality of skin - that is, to the way in which skin functioned as a
means of eliminating waste and protecting the body from harmful substances in
the air. Linked to bodily functions, the idea of skin as a fisherman's net
directly <a href="../misbehaving/skin-disease/index.html">informed concepts of disease</a>,
but it was also a rich metaphor in itself, and it spoke to a literary practice
in the medical treatment of skin which was common throughout the century: the
practice of attempting to define the qualities of skin via metaphor or analogy.

    <p>In 1517, for
example, the German barber-surgeon Hans von Gersdorff, wrote a bestselling
vernacular book "Fieldbook of surgery". Von Gersdorff's text is well
known for its graphic woodcut images of amputations, prosthetics and
trephination, as well as for the text's detailed description of the techniques
involved in each. But notable for Renaissance Skin is the first chapter on
anatomy and the description of skin with which it began. Von Gersdorff
described skin as "Deshalb an der hut ansufahen ist, wann die bekumet an
dem ersten unnd von uffzen als ein rynd des baums. Und ist ein deckel des
leibs/ uff den faede men der sennsen und aderen zusamen gesetzt/ beschaff en
die anderen glyd z beschirmen", i.e. "To begin with the skin, for
considering it [or caring about it][ it is first like the bark of the tree. And
it is the cover of the body, which binds the sinews and the blood together."
This analogy is the earliest we have found to date of what would become a much
more common motif for thinking about skin by the end of the century. In
comparing skin to bark, von Gersdorff, like Mercuriale, was drawing on classical
references, more specifically on an important agricultural text by the Roman
writer Columella.  Der Ackerwerk, which
would be translated into German and printed by the in Von Gersdorff's home town
of Strasbourg some years after the initial appearance of Feldbuch. The analogy
with the bark of the tree spoke to practical overlaps with agriculture, as
surgeons throughout the century investigated grafting techniques, most notably
the Italian Gaspare Tagliacozzi, about whom Paolo has written at more length. The
comparison between skin and bark was only one instance where writers interested
in skin compared it to other natural surfaces, or, alternatively, where writers
interested in other natural surfaces compared it to skin. <a href="../living/citrusmania/index.html">As our project has
found</a>,
early modern concepts of skin extended outwards into the natural world. The
visual ironies of the commonalities between bark and skin may have informed the
frequently referenced artistic trope of the arrow piercing skin, as for example
in Albrecht Dürer's meditation on death in the context of hunting, in the
stag.  </p>

<p>            </p>

<p>But natural
surfaces were not the only medium medical writers drew on when they debated the
nature of skin; artificial surfaces could also be invoked. The correlation
between architecture and anatomy was frequently referenced by writers in both
fields. So, while the architectural writer Vitruvius compared the walls of a
house to the bones of a body, and its paneling to skin, Vesalius, the author of
De Fabrica, compared the body to a house, with the bones as the foundations,
and the skin its surface. Writers using this analogy can be seen as alluding to
the stability produced by skin. They assumed its integral role in maintaining
the structure of the body. This metaphor is especially helpful for thinking
about the cosmetic function of skin, and the way in which decoration and
ornamentation were considered by early modern physicians as physiological
qualities of the body. </p>

    <p><br/></p><p>In the context
of our project, one final metaphor deserves particular mention - the comparison
between skin and clothing. This appeared in numerous different kinds of texts,
from pharmaceutical tracts to philosophical meditations on the purpose of the
body. The visual element in this, in which skin could be put on and taken off,
played out in many different ways, not least in the dramatic écorchés or images
of flayed skin which appeared in anatomical but also in religious imagery of
the time. The poetics of skin as clothing spoke to broader cultural ideas of
the importance of appearance but also its essential instability. Appearances
could inform, they could also deceive. The temporariness and mutability which
lay behind medical descriptions of the essential nature of skin only reinforced
this.  </p>

<p>            </p>

<p>In 1601, the
Wittenberg physician Jan Jessen drew these metaphors together. In his short
tract, De cuta et cutaneis affectibus, Jessen described skin in all these ways.
"Finally, it is the clothing (tegument) of the entire body... for Plato a
great net, for Hippocrates a chain of all the parts of the body, for it is the
sheath of all the organs of the body. Namely a fortification and almost a
bulwark, it evades by thickness and density". Skin as clothing, as a net,
as a chain, as a sheath, as a fortification, or a bulwark - in this list,
Jessen pointed out the many variations that explanations for skin had taken in
the previous century, but he also linked them together, showing how each
metaphor explained a different material quality of skin. </p>

<p>            </p>

<p>Metaphors and
their role in describing skin tell us many different things, not least about
the difficulty in defining skin in the sixteenth century. Unlike other bodily
parts, the function of skin was not well understood (Aristotle denied it had
function, while Galen was ambivalent on the matter). Writers lacked the ability
to provide it with an easy, single-sentence definition. In turning to metaphor
however, early modern writers revealed the multiple material qualities of skin
which coded its interpretation and social function. </p>

                      <h3>Leonhard Thurnheysser&#x27;s Observations on Black Skin</h3> <p>

<div class="page-content">
    
    
    <p>A
recently published article in Renaissance Studies by Bernardo Jerosch Herold
makes available for the first time a translation into English of a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/rest.12332">diary entry by the famous Swiss physician and alchemist Leonhard Thurnheysser</a> (1531-1596).
In it Thurnheysser describes in great detail the skin of "BlackAfricans" - enslaved men and women he saw on the streets of Renaissance
Lisbon. </p><p><br/></p>

<p>The German-speaking lands are often
seen as remote from the slave-trade and the kinds of sea-faring activities
which enabled them. But, as Herold's article clearly shows, the global city of
Lisbon was a trading zone where ideas and people from all over the world
encountered each other. Through investment and finance many German families
were involved in the early slave trade, and German-speaking travellers left
important accounts of their travels and their impressions of different parts of
Africa, of enslaved peoples and of other parts of the world. </p><p><br/></p><p>Thurnheysser describes the
appearance of enslaved men and women at some length:<br/></p><p><br/></p>

<p>"In the country of the Ethiopians or
the Arabs, the inhabitants are called <i>Minae
</i>or <i>Minnaej</i>... [they] are the
mightiest and most beautiful ones... They also have a most smooth, glossy and
even skin, and also their bodies are the most perfect and strong, as compared
to other moors... The moors, however, who come from the islands of D. Thomae or
of the Capitae Viridis or the green head, or from Malagetta, or have been
brought, are not that black, but rather of a dark brown colour and mainly in
their faces..  Several among them had
been strangely adorned as youths by cutting them on both sides of their mouth,
from the forehead until their mouth, in such a way that the cicatrices or scars
of such cuts join the corners of the mouth, and [that] the wounds are far away
from each other, which they consider to be a great adornment...Sometimes they
also cut themselves on their cheeks, near their ears, for health reasons, with
three or four crosswise slashes in order to bleed from them, as it happens with
us when practicing <i>phlebotomia</i> or
bloodletting." (483-484). </p>

<p> </p>

<p>For
obvious reasons, Thurnheysser's account is of special interest to the
Renaissance Skin team. Descriptions of black skin appear in accounts by medical
practitioners throughout the early modern period. In his 1578 <i>The Historie of Man</i>, the English
barber-surgeon John Banister wrote "Every one knoweth that the Moores have
onely white teeth, but blacke skinne and nayles", (before going on to add,
"but it is not a thing so common(ly known) that they and also the
inhabitants of such countries are without seames in their skulls.") In
1646, the physician Thomas Browne contributed what is probably the best known
writings on the subject -  the <i>Pseudodoxia Epidemica</i>, or <i>Vulgar Errors</i>, which dedicated three
chapters to refuting popular misconceptions about the colour of human skin. However,
few of these accounts are derived from personal experience, and fewer still
account for skin as a personal phenomenon. </p>

    <p>As a
relatively early and highly personal reaction to a phenomenon that he has
witnessed 'in the flesh', Thurnheysser is therefore significant. First, while
brief, his account pays attention to regional difference and variation. Thurnheysser
does not 'lump' all enslaved peoples together, but is highly cognizant of
differences, not only in their origin and appearance, but also in customs and
ways of life. He is quick to interpret aesthetic and medical customs, and he is
as interested in markings and alterations to the skin as he is in its colour,
tone or texture. In this sense, it is important to note that although skin often
featured heavily in such accounts, skin<i>
colour</i> was only one part of a larger set of questions writers such as
Thurnheysser had about other people and their cultures. Thurnheysser was
equally, perhaps more, interested in markings, decoration and medicinal uses of
the skin. While he simply mentions variation in skin colour and tone
(contrasting the smooth, glossy and even skin of the <i>Minae</i> to the 'not that dark' skin of the Moors), his extremely
detailed account of the scarification of 'adorned' youths, suggests that he
paid even closer attention to individual markings. Thurnheysser posited that
some of these may have had medical purposes. We cannot know how he reached his
conclusions, or whether he spoke to the young people in question, but here it
is clear that Thurnheysser's own medical interests helped provide a prism
through which he interpreted the marks and practices of another culture. <br/></p>

<p>            </p><p>Such an account of skin, and such
accounting for its importance, was neither systemic, nor theoretical. It was
not inherited from Hippocrates or Aristotle. It was not (unlike much of
Thurnheysser's other writing about savageness or strength) a matter of received
discourse, i.e. induced by the dominant tropes of cultural discourse, or held
in common with the majority of other literary treatments. So what, precisely,
does it mean? </p>

<p><br/></p><p>This
blog post is not intended to offer any definite answers; merely to point out
the significance of such a personal account and the idiosyncrasy of its
contents.  Thurnheysser's private diary
makes clear that early modern medical writers encountered skin in highly
personal ways. There was no single or even dominant explanation for the colour
of skin. There was no established consensus on the importance of skin colour.
While it is impossible to divorce Thurnheysser's interrogation of the meaning
of "moorish" skin from the context of the slave market in which he
encountered it, (nor would it be desirable to do so), it remains important to
stress that even in such depersonalizing contexts, skin was, for Thurnheysser at
least, a site of personal expression and subjectivity, and subsequently a locus
for the making of cultural meaning and medical speculation. </p><p><br/></p><p>Main Image: Leonhard Thurnheysser, Etching, c.16th Century. Courtesy US National Library of

                              <h3>Leonhard Thurnheysser&#x27;s Observations on Black Skin</h3> 

<div class="page-content">
    
    
    <p>A
recently published article in Renaissance Studies by Bernardo Jerosch Herold
makes available for the first time a translation into English of a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/rest.12332">diary entry by the famous Swiss physician and alchemist Leonhard Thurnheysser</a> (1531-1596).
In it Thurnheysser describes in great detail the skin of "BlackAfricans" - enslaved men and women he saw on the streets of Renaissance
Lisbon. </p><p><br/></p>

<p>The German-speaking lands are often
seen as remote from the slave-trade and the kinds of sea-faring activities
which enabled them. But, as Herold's article clearly shows, the global city of
Lisbon was a trading zone where ideas and people from all over the world
encountered each other. Through investment and finance many German families
were involved in the early slave trade, and German-speaking travellers left
important accounts of their travels and their impressions of different parts of
Africa, of enslaved peoples and of other parts of the world. </p><p><br/></p><p>Thurnheysser describes the
appearance of enslaved men and women at some length:<br/></p><p><br/></p>

<p>"In the country of the Ethiopians or
the Arabs, the inhabitants are called <i>Minae
</i>or <i>Minnaej</i>... [they] are the
mightiest and most beautiful ones... They also have a most smooth, glossy and
even skin, and also their bodies are the most perfect and strong, as compared
to other moors... The moors, however, who come from the islands of D. Thomae or
of the Capitae Viridis or the green head, or from Malagetta, or have been
brought, are not that black, but rather of a dark brown colour and mainly in
their faces..  Several among them had
been strangely adorned as youths by cutting them on both sides of their mouth,
from the forehead until their mouth, in such a way that the cicatrices or scars
of such cuts join the corners of the mouth, and [that] the wounds are far away
from each other, which they consider to be a great adornment...Sometimes they
also cut themselves on their cheeks, near their ears, for health reasons, with
three or four crosswise slashes in order to bleed from them, as it happens with
us when practicing <i>phlebotomia</i> or
bloodletting." (483-484). </p>

<p> </p>

<p>For
obvious reasons, Thurnheysser's account is of special interest to the
Renaissance Skin team. Descriptions of black skin appear in accounts by medical
practitioners throughout the early modern period. In his 1578 <i>The Historie of Man</i>, the English
barber-surgeon John Banister wrote "Every one knoweth that the Moores have
onely white teeth, but blacke skinne and nayles", (before going on to add,
"but it is not a thing so common(ly known) that they and also the
inhabitants of such countries are without seames in their skulls.") In
1646, the physician Thomas Browne contributed what is probably the best known
writings on the subject -  the <i>Pseudodoxia Epidemica</i>, or <i>Vulgar Errors</i>, which dedicated three
chapters to refuting popular misconceptions about the colour of human skin. However,
few of these accounts are derived from personal experience, and fewer still
account for skin as a personal phenomenon. </p>

    <p>As a
relatively early and highly personal reaction to a phenomenon that he has
witnessed 'in the flesh', Thurnheysser is therefore significant. First, while
brief, his account pays attention to regional difference and variation. Thurnheysser
does not 'lump' all enslaved peoples together, but is highly cognizant of
differences, not only in their origin and appearance, but also in customs and
ways of life. He is quick to interpret aesthetic and medical customs, and he is
as interested in markings and alterations to the skin as he is in its colour,
tone or texture. In this sense, it is important to note that although skin often
featured heavily in such accounts, skin<i>
colour</i> was only one part of a larger set of questions writers such as
Thurnheysser had about other people and their cultures. Thurnheysser was
equally, perhaps more, interested in markings, decoration and medicinal uses of
the skin. While he simply mentions variation in skin colour and tone
(contrasting the smooth, glossy and even skin of the <i>Minae</i> to the 'not that dark' skin of the Moors), his extremely
detailed account of the scarification of 'adorned' youths, suggests that he
paid even closer attention to individual markings. Thurnheysser posited that
some of these may have had medical purposes. We cannot know how he reached his
conclusions, or whether he spoke to the young people in question, but here it
is clear that Thurnheysser's own medical interests helped provide a prism
through which he interpreted the marks and practices of another culture. <br/></p>

<p>            </p><p>Such an account of skin, and such
accounting for its importance, was neither systemic, nor theoretical. It was
not inherited from Hippocrates or Aristotle. It was not (unlike much of
Thurnheysser's other writing about savageness or strength) a matter of received
discourse, i.e. induced by the dominant tropes of cultural discourse, or held
in common with the majority of other literary treatments. So what, precisely,
does it mean? </p>

<p><br/></p><p>This
blog post is not intended to offer any definite answers; merely to point out
the significance of such a personal account and the idiosyncrasy of its
contents.  Thurnheysser's private diary
makes clear that early modern medical writers encountered skin in highly
personal ways. There was no single or even dominant explanation for the colour
of skin. There was no established consensus on the importance of skin colour.
While it is impossible to divorce Thurnheysser's interrogation of the meaning
of "moorish" skin from the context of the slave market in which he
encountered it, (nor would it be desirable to do so), it remains important to
stress that even in such depersonalizing contexts, skin was, for Thurnheysser at
least, a site of personal expression and subjectivity, and subsequently a locus
for the making of cultural meaning and medical speculation. </p><p><br/></p><p>Main Image: Leonhard Thurnheysser, Etching, c.16th Century. Courtesy US National Library of

                      <h3>Questions about skin in Omnes homines (‘Problems of Aristotle’)</h3> <p>

<div class="page-content">
    
    
    <p>In just under four hundred questions, a hugely popular text that
circulated in late medieval and early modern Europe under the title, tried to
provide short answers to questions as varied as why do cats’ eyes shine in the
dark or why do men sneeze. The text was termed in both the original Latin and
in its vernacular translations as the “Problemata Aristotelis” (Problems of
Aristotle). However it should not be confused with the ‘original’ ancient <i>Problemata
Aristotelis</i>, which is a collection of around nine hundred question and
answers composed in Ancient Greek by multiple sources and authors. Following
the ancient model of question and answers, the popular early modern Problems of
Aristolte, was composed probably around the fourteenth or fifteenth century. </p><p><br/></p><p>Like its classical model, it focuses on questions regarding the body and
natural history, and has been titled <i>Omnes homines</i> (from its Latin
incipit) in modern scholarship. Numerous editions circulated in Latin, English,
French and German, from the late middle ages to the twentieth century. Questions
were often added or removed in editions, and other texts might augment the
volume. The early English translation cited below, published in Edinburgh in
1595, also included translations of an shortened version of the Problems of
Alexander Aphrodisias (c. 3<sup>rd</sup> century AD) and problems written in
the same format by the Italian philosopher MarcAntonio Zimara (d. 1532). </p>

<p> </p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Unsurprisingly, there are many references to skin and hair in Omnes
homines, and here is a small selection:  </p><p><br/></p>

<p><b>(5) Question. Why haue women longer hayre then
men?</b></p><p>Answer.
Because women are moyster than men, and more flegmatick, and therefore there is more matter of hayre in them, and by
a consequence, the length also of their hayre doth follow. And further more this matter is more increased in
women then in men, from the interior
parts, and especially in the time of their monthlie tearmes and flowres,
because the matter doth then
ascend, Wherby the humor Which breedeth the hayre doth encrease. And   Albertus doth say, that if the hayre of a
woman in the time of her flowers be put into doung,    a venemous serpent is engendered of it. The second answer is,
because women want beards, and so
the matter of the beard doth goe into the matter of hayre.</p><p>         </p>

<p><b>[7] Question. Why haue some men curled hayre
and some smoothe?</b></p><p>Answer.
The answer is, that the cause of the curling of the hayre is great abundance of
heate, so that if there be much heate
in a man then his hayre doth curle, and grow vpward. And a signe of this is proued true,
because that sometimes a man doth enter into a bath smoothe hayred, and afterward by the bath becommeth
curled. And therefore the keepers of bathes haue
often curled hayre, and also the Aethiopians and cholericke men. But the cause
of the smoothnes, is the abundance
of moyst humors, Which tend downeward, and a proofe of this is, because that women for the most part
haue smoothe hayre, because they haue much humiditie
in them and small heate.</p><p></p>

<p>         </p>

<p><b>[12] Question. Why are women smoothe and fayre
in respect of men?</b></p><p>Answer.
The answer is according vnto Aristotle <i>De Generatione Animalium</i> because
that in women all humiditie and
superfluitie, Which are the matter and cause of the bayre of the bodie is expelled with their monthly tearmes,
the Which superfluitie remaineth in men, and through
vapors doth passe into hayre. And a signe of this is, because women haue
seldome any running at the nose, or
impostume, or ulcer, because such matter is expelled also. And we see some olde women begin to haue a beard
in their olde age, that is after fortie or fiftie yeares of age, When their flowers haue ceased, as Aristotle
doth teach <i>De animalibus liber 9</i>.</p><p><br/></p><p><b>[368]
Question. Why are such as sleepe much euill disposed, and haue an</b><b> ill</b><b> colour?</b></p>

<p>Because
that in sleep much moysture is gathered together, Which cannot be consumed, Which is expelled in waking: and
so it doth couet to goe out through the superficiall parts of the bodie, and especially it coueteth
to the face, &amp; so is cause of a bad colourias it appeareth in such as are fleugmatike Who
desire more sleepe then others.</p>

<p> </p><p><br/></p><p>Animals are not neglected either, as this question asks after asking
numerous queries on why people go grey:</p>

<p>               </p><p><b>[15]
Question. Why doe Wolues grow grislie?</b></p><p>Answer.
The better to vnderstand this question, note the difference betwixt graynes and grislynes, because that
graynes is caused through the defect of a naturall heate, but grislienes through deuouring and eating, as
Aristotle witnesseth, 7. <i>de animalibus</i> The Wolfe being a very deuouring beast, and a great
eater, he letteth it downe gluttonoasly without chewing,  and that at once enough for three dayes: of Which
meate grosse vapours are engendered in the
Wolfes body, &amp; by a consequence grislienes Secondly, graynes and grislines
do differ, because graynes is onely in
the head, and grislines ouer all the bodie.</p>

<p><br/></p><p><br/></p>

<p>The answers are not novel, and are based on standard humoreal theory.
However they are helpful in understanding how early modern readers not trained
in contemporary medical discourse, might understand how the body functioned and
how puzzling might be understood. And I hope it might encourage blog readers to
explore this wonderful text and read on why your hair stands up on end or how
to tell whether a person is a wrong’un by looking at their nails... </p>

                      <h3>Caspar Netscher’s Slaughtered Pig (1662)</h3> <p>

<div class="page-content">
    
    
    <p>In <i>The Slaughtered Pig </i>(1662), Caspar
Netscher depicted a hybrid domestic scene that gravitates between kitchen
interior, laboratory, workshop, and still life painting. The space in the
foreground of the panel is entirely occupied by the stretched skin of the
freshly flayed animal. The pig’s head has been quartered and set aside, and its
guts have been appropriately cleaned and put inside the earthenware jug behind
it, by its feet. The skin hangs wide open on a wooden ladder, like the surface
of the stretched-out canvas on a wooden easel. The artist offers a detailed,
surgical view (in the sense of both operation and inquisition) of the animal’s
interior: fluid brushstrokes in various shades of white and lighter tones of
red delineate the extended body of the pig, mimicking the elasticity of the
skin covering its drawn out tissues and muscles. At the center of both the
image and the animal’s corpse, we find the pig’s kidneys, depicted as two
perfectly round, symmetrical and full spheres.</p><p><br/></p><p>Although the hands and the labour
behind the preparation of the animal’s body have been erased, there is yet one human
element that remains visible. Behind the flayed body of the pig and its
chopped-off head, a kid takes the empty bladder of the pig with both of his
hands; he holds its neck firmly with his right hand, and places the other
gently upon the thin and transparent surface of the bladder’s tissue. He brings
the bubble-shaped organ to his mouth, and blows. As he pumps, he fills in the
insides of both the organic pouch and his cheeks, whose surface too becomes
round, full, and flushed.<br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Skin does not only possess tactile
and visual properties, but it can also be apprehended through taste. In
that sense, the skin of Netscher’s slaughtered pig possessed multiple sensory
affordances and possible afterlives: it could be flayed, gutted, stretched,
hanged, boiled, cooked, licked, sucked, chewed, digested, dissected, painted,
displayed, and seen.<br/></p><p><br/></p><p>In his series of letters to the
Royal Society, the seventeenth century Dutch scientist Anton van Leeuwenhoek described a
world made up of an infinite number of globular particles in continuous
interaction, as if in one shared and extended skin. Contrary to general belief,
he did not only rely on vision and the microscope—a visual tool, nor did he
only account for the visible aspects of the world, in order to make sense of
the world. For the early modern man, anything that could be sensed, could be
known.<br/></p><p><br/></p>

<p>Leeuwenhoek reflects on the sense of
taste as object and method of inquiry. When he accounts for taste, he does so
based on the physical effect caused by the touch of the particles that make up
one substance against the surface of the skin of the tongue. For instance, the
sharp angles of the pricks on the surface of a pepper corn press hard into the
globules of the tongue, causing its pungent flavour.</p><p><br/></p>

<p>On the other hand, Leeuwenhoek
performed a number of gustatory practices as valid means for investigation. In
a letter from 1674, he described the process of cutting
up the brain of a cow with a knife, and then he indicates: ‘I apply my mouth, and there suck as
strongly as I can.’ The Dutch scientist might have obtained the head of the cow
from his local butcher, laid it open, and observed it within the walls of his
own kitchen in Delft. In fact, domestic dissection and using one’s mouth as a
tool for experimentation was a common early modern scientific practice. For
instance, after his arrival in Amsterdam in 1629, René Descartes narrates: ‘I
went nearly every day to the house of a butcher, to see him kill animals, and
brought from there to my lodgings the parts that I wished to anatomize more at
leisure.’ William Harvey, Regnier de Graaf, and Marcello Malpighi tasted,
compared, and assessed the flavour of various human and animal organs and
secretions. After having sucked the matter from
the cow’s head, Leeuwenhoek put it under the microscope, and saw it was made of
bubbles, just as the teeth of a cow, saliva, canvas, wood, sugar, salt, beaten
glass. In that sense, the mouth and the reflecting surface of the microscope,
became the second skin worn by the naked eye, making subject to perception what
would otherwise have remained invisible.</p><p><br/></p><p>The place of taste, however, went
beyond the walls of the kitchen and the laboratory. In his<i> Libro del</i><i>l’arte</i> (1437), the
Italian Renaissance artist and writer Cennino Cennini instructed the reader, an
apprentice on the art of painting, to grease a stone with bacon fat or lard, in
order to make reliefs for wall or panel painting. And when the Flemish artist
and writer Karel van Mander described the work painted from life by Brueghel
the Elder, he tells: ‘he swallowed all those mountains and rocks which, upon
returning home, he spat them out again onto canvas and panels.’ This might
suggest that representations of reality were not conceived purely in visual
terms via the exercise of mental faculties. Instead, they were built with the
things and interactions that make the world itself.<br/></p><p><br/></p><p>When Netscher introduced the
bubble-blowing character in the painting, he was not only showing his painterly
skill to depict reflecting surfaces, nor was he only laying a visual argument
for the fragility of life, according to the traditional moral interpretation
of the <i>Homo Bulla</i>, or of organic matter in a stage of decomposition. The
artist is making visible the very fabric of the world—one that can also be
tasted. When the viewer (a butcher, a handmaid, a scientist, a maker) stands in
front of Netscher’s painting, is the glaze covering the inflated bladder or the
ocular-looking pair of kidneys of the pig, lubricating something more than the
surface of the wood and the eyes of the viewer? Are they not only seeing, but
also tasting?<br/></p>

                      <h3>Marking Difference: Skin and Hierarchies in the Philippines</h3> <p>

<div class="page-content">
    
    
    <p>During their attempt to
establish a Spanish foothold in the Philippines in 1565, the expedition led by
Miguel de Legazpi learned the surprising news of “a Christian named Juanes, who
had been living with the locals for more than twenty years”. This Juanes turned
out to be a native of Mexico brought to the Philippines as a cabin boy on the previous
voyage of Ruy López de Villalobos (1542–4). He was then captured by the locals
and joined their community. The strongest testimony to his shocking
transformation came from his own body, now proudly adorned with innumerable
tattoos. The Spanish pleas to rejoin them left Juanes cold. His skin markings
tied him to his adopted community and separated him from his former countrymen.</p><p><br/></p><p>As this anecdote reveals, upon their arrival in
the Philippines the Spanish entered a world of marked skin. Filipino
communities had long been engaged in a range of skin practices such as
tattooing and cauterisation, as well as various kinds of body piercing, including
ear adornments and penis pins. Underneath these markings, there were bodies of
various complexions, ranging from light to dark. This complex topography has
lately come under the scrutiny of our project. One of the rare sources that provides
visual representations of these encounters is the so-called <i>Boxer Codex</i>,
a Spanish collection of descriptions and images
of various ethnic groups of the Philippines and southeast Asia more broadly.</p><p><br/></p><p>The <i>Codex</i> was assembled in Manila at the end of the sixteenth century. Its origins remain shrouded in mystery: the commissioner, compiler, illustrator and most authors of its individual accounts are all unknown. The purpose of the volume was probably to document people of southeast Asia and present intelligence on their appearance, nature and customs as gathered by Spanish observers. Whatever the intentions of its creators, the work was never completed, copied or published. It found its way to Spain sometime at the turn of the sixteenth century, where it was bound, and it subsequently disappeared for some three hundred years. It did not re-emerge until the early twentieth century in Britain, then in possession of the Earls of Ilchester. In 1947, it was purchased by the spy turned historian and collector Charles Ralph Boxer, whose name the <i>Codex</i> now bears. It is currently held in the Lilly Library at Indiana University, Bloomington.</p><p></p>

    <p><br/></p><p>The illustrations featured in the <i>Codex</i> yield glimpses of Spanish colonial visions and the hierarchies put into place with the aim to define, classify and control ‘other’ people. In this context, skin emerges as a canvas onto which markers of human difference were inscribed. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the main feature mobilised to that end was skin colour. In the <i>Codex</i>, the ‘pacified’ and Christianised Visayan and Tagalog people are portrayed as lighter in skin colour than the mountain-dwelling Aeta, Zambales and Cagayan communities, who resisted Castilian sovereignty. Early colonial accounts regularly drew such contrasts between the dark-skinned raiders from the highlands and the light-skinned communities in coastal areas, who were deemed more peaceful, moral and civil. In such accounts, light skin colour was typically coupled with ‘other’ approving adjectives in order to emphasise its superior nature. These skin colour hierarchies were of course highly subjective: the same people could be portrayed as darker or lighter depending on the motivations of the author. For instance, the Jesuit missionary Pedro Chirino claimed in his <i>Relacion</i> (1604) that the inhabitants of the island Bohol were “of lighter complexion [and] generally more gracious than other Visayans”, as well as of greater spirit and valour, and have soon “abandoned all of their immoral practices, alongside their idolatry”.<br/></p><p><br/></p>

    <p><br/></p><p>The humoral understanding of the human body, adopted by the Spanish, posited that skin colour could be altered by external influences, such as the climate. Therefore, it is hard to make clear associations with modern racial hierarchies, which are built upon the idea of stable, hereditary traits. However, scholars such as Cord Whitaker have recently shown that the prejudices attached to the currently racialised characteristic of skin colour predate its modern racialisation. By the Late Middle Ages, bias against blackness and towards whiteness had become deeply ingrained in European religious thought and poetic imagery. In line with these ideas, it seems that for the Spanish, skin colour yielded important clues about the prospects of their colonial enterprise. It provided information about the underlying humanity and character of Philippine inhabitants and about their potential for civilisation and conversion. Perhaps dark bodies may also have alluded to the dangers associated inhospitable climate, whilst the presence of light-complexioned people offered hopes for the establishment of a healthy colony.</p><p><br/></p>

    </div>
    
</div>
    
    
    
    <p>In the <i>Codex</i>, the link between skin colour and civility is further complemented by the use of clothing and other features that possessed established associations with civilisation and morality, or the lack thereof. The practically naked bodies of the Aeta and Zambales people are wrapped merely in loincloth, whose plain white colour sharply contrasts with the exposed dark skin of its bearers (Figures 2, 3). In comparison, the bodies of Visayan and Tagalog nobility are covered in colourful fabrics embroidered with gold (Figures 4, 5). Although both Visayan and Tagalog serfs proudly display their naked skin, the contrast with their lavishly dressed leaders serves to indicate a sophisticated social system of an orderly, civil society. To leave no one in doubt, Visayan and Tagalog élites carry insignia of status in the form of golden swords and jewellery. In contrast, in the hands of darker-skinned communities, swords become lethal weapons. One of the images depicts a bleeding buffalo, its skin cut wide open by one of the Zambal hunters in search of their delicacy: raw, unwashed buffalo intestines (Figure 3). Rather than wielding primitive and undecorated weapons, the Christianised Visayans and Tagalogs use their hands to make pious gestures, symbolic of their morality. Their orderly hair, cut short in Castilian fashion, likewise reflects the internal order of their communities and civility.</p>

    <p><br/></p><p>Skin
colour was used to mark differences not only between indigenous communities,
but also between the sexes. Both in the <i>Boxer Codex</i> and in Spanish
written accounts more broadly, females were portrayed as lighter in skin tone
than their male counterparts from the same ethnic groups (Figure 5). As early
modern European cultures associated fair complexion with beauty, the light
female skin – prudishly covered in embroidered fabric – can be understood as
part of the colonisers’ highly sexualised portrayal of Philippine women.
Indeed, European accounts were saturated with sexual attraction to local females,
who were “very beautiful and almost as white as our women” in the words of
Antonio Pigafetta, the chronicler of the Magellan expedition. Such favourable
comparisons of Philippine women to their European counterparts reflected and
legitimised the colonisers’ carnal desires.<br/></p><p></p><p></p>

<p><br/></p><p>The
<i>Boxer Codex</i> is well-known for containing one of the few surviving early
modern depictions of Philippine tattoo (Figure 1). This peculiar practice was
especially prevalent in the Visayas: a group of diverse islands, whose
inhabitants were thus unified in Spanish minds into a single ethnic group named
<i>Pintados</i>, the ‘Painted’ or ‘Tattooed Ones’. Spanish
sources universally portrayed the Visayan tattoo as a predominantly male affair
closely associated with status: obtaining one required committing a heroic
deed, and only the most valiant and prominent men earned the right to have
full-body tattoos. These views, however, were not carried over into their visualisation.
The <i>Codex</i> depicts Visayan noblemen as fully clothed and without skin markings,
whilst the naked bodies of commoners are adorned with full-body tattoos. This
discrepancy between written and visual sources may indicate something deeper
about the perceived inverse association between status and civility on the one

                              <h3>Marking Difference: Skin and Hierarchies in the Philippines</h3> 

<div class="page-content">
    
    
    <p>During their attempt to
establish a Spanish foothold in the Philippines in 1565, the expedition led by
Miguel de Legazpi learned the surprising news of “a Christian named Juanes, who
had been living with the locals for more than twenty years”. This Juanes turned
out to be a native of Mexico brought to the Philippines as a cabin boy on the previous
voyage of Ruy López de Villalobos (1542–4). He was then captured by the locals
and joined their community. The strongest testimony to his shocking
transformation came from his own body, now proudly adorned with innumerable
tattoos. The Spanish pleas to rejoin them left Juanes cold. His skin markings
tied him to his adopted community and separated him from his former countrymen.</p><p><br/></p><p>As this anecdote reveals, upon their arrival in
the Philippines the Spanish entered a world of marked skin. Filipino
communities had long been engaged in a range of skin practices such as
tattooing and cauterisation, as well as various kinds of body piercing, including
ear adornments and penis pins. Underneath these markings, there were bodies of
various complexions, ranging from light to dark. This complex topography has
lately come under the scrutiny of our project. One of the rare sources that provides
visual representations of these encounters is the so-called <i>Boxer Codex</i>,
a Spanish collection of descriptions and images
of various ethnic groups of the Philippines and southeast Asia more broadly.</p><p><br/></p><p>The <i>Codex</i> was assembled in Manila at the end of the sixteenth century. Its origins remain shrouded in mystery: the commissioner, compiler, illustrator and most authors of its individual accounts are all unknown. The purpose of the volume was probably to document people of southeast Asia and present intelligence on their appearance, nature and customs as gathered by Spanish observers. Whatever the intentions of its creators, the work was never completed, copied or published. It found its way to Spain sometime at the turn of the sixteenth century, where it was bound, and it subsequently disappeared for some three hundred years. It did not re-emerge until the early twentieth century in Britain, then in possession of the Earls of Ilchester. In 1947, it was purchased by the spy turned historian and collector Charles Ralph Boxer, whose name the <i>Codex</i> now bears. It is currently held in the Lilly Library at Indiana University, Bloomington.</p><p></p>

    <p><br/></p><p>The illustrations featured in the <i>Codex</i> yield glimpses of Spanish colonial visions and the hierarchies put into place with the aim to define, classify and control ‘other’ people. In this context, skin emerges as a canvas onto which markers of human difference were inscribed. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the main feature mobilised to that end was skin colour. In the <i>Codex</i>, the ‘pacified’ and Christianised Visayan and Tagalog people are portrayed as lighter in skin colour than the mountain-dwelling Aeta, Zambales and Cagayan communities, who resisted Castilian sovereignty. Early colonial accounts regularly drew such contrasts between the dark-skinned raiders from the highlands and the light-skinned communities in coastal areas, who were deemed more peaceful, moral and civil. In such accounts, light skin colour was typically coupled with ‘other’ approving adjectives in order to emphasise its superior nature. These skin colour hierarchies were of course highly subjective: the same people could be portrayed as darker or lighter depending on the motivations of the author. For instance, the Jesuit missionary Pedro Chirino claimed in his <i>Relacion</i> (1604) that the inhabitants of the island Bohol were “of lighter complexion [and] generally more gracious than other Visayans”, as well as of greater spirit and valour, and have soon “abandoned all of their immoral practices, alongside their idolatry”.<br/></p><p><br/></p>

    <p><br/></p><p>The humoral understanding of the human body, adopted by the Spanish, posited that skin colour could be altered by external influences, such as the climate. Therefore, it is hard to make clear associations with modern racial hierarchies, which are built upon the idea of stable, hereditary traits. However, scholars such as Cord Whitaker have recently shown that the prejudices attached to the currently racialised characteristic of skin colour predate its modern racialisation. By the Late Middle Ages, bias against blackness and towards whiteness had become deeply ingrained in European religious thought and poetic imagery. In line with these ideas, it seems that for the Spanish, skin colour yielded important clues about the prospects of their colonial enterprise. It provided information about the underlying humanity and character of Philippine inhabitants and about their potential for civilisation and conversion. Perhaps dark bodies may also have alluded to the dangers associated inhospitable climate, whilst the presence of light-complexioned people offered hopes for the establishment of a healthy colony.</p><p><br/></p>

</div>
    
    
    
    <p>In the <i>Codex</i>, the link between skin colour and civility is further complemented by the use of clothing and other features that possessed established associations with civilisation and morality, or the lack thereof. The practically naked bodies of the Aeta and Zambales people are wrapped merely in loincloth, whose plain white colour sharply contrasts with the exposed dark skin of its bearers (Figures 2, 3). In comparison, the bodies of Visayan and Tagalog nobility are covered in colourful fabrics embroidered with gold (Figures 4, 5). Although both Visayan and Tagalog serfs proudly display their naked skin, the contrast with their lavishly dressed leaders serves to indicate a sophisticated social system of an orderly, civil society. To leave no one in doubt, Visayan and Tagalog élites carry insignia of status in the form of golden swords and jewellery. In contrast, in the hands of darker-skinned communities, swords become lethal weapons. One of the images depicts a bleeding buffalo, its skin cut wide open by one of the Zambal hunters in search of their delicacy: raw, unwashed buffalo intestines (Figure 3). Rather than wielding primitive and undecorated weapons, the Christianised Visayans and Tagalogs use their hands to make pious gestures, symbolic of their morality. Their orderly hair, cut short in Castilian fashion, likewise reflects the internal order of their communities and civility.</p>

    <p><br/></p><p>Skin
colour was used to mark differences not only between indigenous communities,
but also between the sexes. Both in the <i>Boxer Codex</i> and in Spanish
written accounts more broadly, females were portrayed as lighter in skin tone
than their male counterparts from the same ethnic groups (Figure 5). As early
modern European cultures associated fair complexion with beauty, the light
female skin – prudishly covered in embroidered fabric – can be understood as
part of the colonisers’ highly sexualised portrayal of Philippine women.
Indeed, European accounts were saturated with sexual attraction to local females,
who were “very beautiful and almost as white as our women” in the words of
Antonio Pigafetta, the chronicler of the Magellan expedition. Such favourable
comparisons of Philippine women to their European counterparts reflected and
legitimised the colonisers’ carnal desires.<br/></p><p></p><p></p>

<p><br/></p><p>The
<i>Boxer Codex</i> is well-known for containing one of the few surviving early
modern depictions of Philippine tattoo (Figure 1). This peculiar practice was
especially prevalent in the Visayas: a group of diverse islands, whose
inhabitants were thus unified in Spanish minds into a single ethnic group named
<i>Pintados</i>, the ‘Painted’ or ‘Tattooed Ones’. Spanish
sources universally portrayed the Visayan tattoo as a predominantly male affair
closely associated with status: obtaining one required committing a heroic
deed, and only the most valiant and prominent men earned the right to have
full-body tattoos. These views, however, were not carried over into their visualisation.
The <i>Codex</i> depicts Visayan noblemen as fully clothed and without skin markings,
whilst the naked bodies of commoners are adorned with full-body tattoos. This
discrepancy between written and visual sources may indicate something deeper
about the perceived inverse association between status and civility on the one
hand, and the display of tattoos and nakedness on the other. There was no place
for unmarked Europeans in a world of honourably marked skin and no room for tattooed
Visayan bodies in a world of Christian purity and Spanish colonial order. The
difference between the two cultures was
permanently inscribed upon their skin.</p><p><br/></p><p>SK</p><p><br/></p><p><b>Title image</b> Figure 1: Visayan<i> </i>inhabitants displaying their tattoos

                      <h3>“Not quite black”: Textual and visual translations of Brazilian skin in the Czech lands, c.1590</h3> <p>

<div class="page-content">
    
    
    <p>In 1557, the French Huguenot Jean de Léry (1536–1613) was
sent as a missionary to France Antarctique, a colony newly established in the
Bay of Rio de Janeiro as part of the project to create the first Protestant
mission in the New World. Based on his experiences, which included two months
spent among the indigenous Tupinambá people, de Léry later published a ‘History
of a Voyage to the Land of Brazil’ (<i>Histoire d’un voyage fait en la terre de
Brésil</i>, 1578). In his account, he provided detailed descriptions of
Brazilian nature and indigenous culture and customs, including practices of
skin marking. The publication also featured several woodcuts depicting the
Tupinambá people. De Léry’s work garnered wide attention across Europe, and
several editions in various languages had appeared by the end of the sixteenth
century. This included a Czech translation, produced in 1590. The two
translators, Pavel Slovák (d.1604) and Matěj Cyrus (1566–1618), were both
members of the Unity of the Brethren, a Czech Reformation Church, which
probably instigated the entire undertaking. How were Brazilian realities
translated in the landlocked Czech lands? And why did a Czech Protestant
community seek to translate de Léry’s account in the first place? </p><p><br/></p>

<p>The origins of the Czech translation may be attributed to
the close relations between the Brethren and the Calvinists. Despite the effort
required to render de Léry’s account into Czech, the translation was never
published and survives only as a single, illustrated copy, held in the Fürstenberg
Library at Křivoklát castle. In fact, as Slovák and Cyrus reveal in their preface,
they “did not intend to publish this book”. It therefore seems likely that the
work was to serve merely the internal needs of the Unity. In the late sixteenth
century, the Counter-Reformation, spearheaded by the Jesuits, was making
significant gains in the Czech lands, and ushered in dark times for the
Protestants. The Unity perhaps saw in the Americas the opportunity to escape
from the increasingly Catholic-dominated realms and to build a new Christendom
among the indigenous people of the New World, unspoiled by European
civilisation. </p><p><br/></p>

<p>Indeed, following the Protestant defeat at White Mountain
(1620), the Unity of the Brethren was banned in the Czech lands, and its
members were forced to either convert or go into exile. Some decided to travel
as missionaries to the Americas, where they may have drawn on the lessons
learned from de Léry’s translation. Although the text’s circulation probably remained
relatively restricted, the translation indicates that interest in the
colonisation of new worlds extended beyond the usual naval powers and into the
heart of Europe. Whilst the translation was produced for the needs of the
Unity, the surviving manuscript bears marks of Catholic readership too. Several
pages describing a Calvinist mass have been torn out, whilst some folios have
been inscribed with demeaning marginalia, such as: “All of you Lutherans and
Hussites, kiss our ass; all of you in hell with Luther and Huss, beast one like
the other.” </p><p><br/></p>

<p>The translation of de Léry’s prose into Czech was a
challenging task. Words for many of the matters described were not readily
available in sixteenth-century Czech language. As Slovák and Cyrus explained in
their preface, they decided to leave foreign terms in their original reading
“for fear of rendering their meaning more obscure” by trying to translate them.
These included specialist terms, such as <i>zona torrida</i> and <i>acus
nautica</i> (‘compass’), as well as novelties like toucan and tapir, which
appeared in Czech probably for the very first time. Some animals received more
creative treatment, such as the ‘sea turtle’ which became a “marine snail”. </p><p><br/></p>

    <p>One of the most interesting aspects of the manuscript’s translation history is the translators’ effort to describe the skin colour and markings of the Tupinambá people, which were portrayed in detail by de Léry. To approximate to his readers the appearance and purpose of the tattooed motifs which were used to decorate the bodies of Tupinambá warriors, de Léry compared the designs to dress. This analogy finds parallels in other European accounts of tattooing, as shown by Juliet Fleming, Katherine Dauge-Roth and others. In their Czech translation Slovák and Cyrus, turned to Italian fashion and likened leg tattoos to <i>galioty</i>, an early Czech word for breeches rooted in the Italian <i>caligote</i>. An early modern Czech reader may therefore have imagined the Tupinambá as walking around dressed in fashionable trousers!<br/></p><p><br/></p><p>De
Léry also devoted attention to the indigenes’ skin tone. In his words, it was
“not quite black”, which Slovák and Cyrus turned to <i>osmahlý</i>, literally meaning
“lightly fried or burned”. This word was generally used to describe the effects
of heat, whether in terms of cooking food or the scorching sun. The translation
hints at the underlying understanding of differences in skin colour as a
consequence of variations in the climate, as posited by humoral theory. The
textual portrayal of Tupinambá skin, however, was not carried over into the
illustrations accompanying the Czech translation. The surviving manuscript was
furnished with rather amateurishly produced figures, which had been copied over
from de Léry’s original. These images were coloured, and later censored by a
rather prudish reader for nudity. Rather than being dark and tattooed, the
Tupinambá appear here with fair hair and pale skin. The reasons for this
portrayal are unclear. Perhaps the white unblemished skin was meant to reflect
the ‘natural state’ of the indigenes, who were to carry and embody the
Reformationist hopes of returning to the pristine state of the Creation and the
early Church. As much as the translation, the illustrations of Tupinambá skin
would have reflected the Brethren’s desire to establish a new foundation for
Christendom in the New World.<br/></p>

    <p>One of the most interesting aspects of the manuscript’s translation history is the translators’ effort to describe the skin colour and markings of the Tupinambá people, which were portrayed in detail by de Léry. To approximate to his readers the appearance and purpose of the tattooed motifs which were used to decorate the bodies of Tupinambá warriors, de Léry compared the designs to dress. This analogy finds parallels in other European accounts of tattooing, as shown by Juliet Fleming, Katherine Dauge-Roth and others. In their Czech translation Slovák and Cyrus, turned to Italian fashion and likened leg tattoos to <i>galioty</i>, an early Czech word for breeches rooted in the Italian <i>caligote</i>. An early modern Czech reader may therefore have imagined the Tupinambá as walking around dressed in fashionable trousers!<br/></p><p><br/></p><p>De
Léry also devoted attention to the indigenes’ skin tone. In his words, it was
“not quite black”, which Slovák and Cyrus turned to <i>osmahlý</i>, literally meaning
“lightly fried or burned”. This word was generally used to describe the effects
of heat, whether in terms of cooking food or the scorching sun. The translation
hints at the underlying understanding of differences in skin colour as a
consequence of variations in the climate, as posited by humoral theory. The
textual portrayal of Tupinambá skin, however, was not carried over into the
illustrations accompanying the Czech translation. The surviving manuscript was
furnished with rather amateurishly produced figures, which had been copied over
from de Léry’s original. These images were coloured, and later censored by a
rather prudish reader for nudity. Rather than being dark and tattooed, the
Tupinambá appear here with fair hair and pale skin. The reasons for this
portrayal are unclear. Perhaps the white unblemished skin was meant to reflect
the ‘natural state’ of the indigenes, who were to carry and embody the
Reformationist hopes of returning to the pristine state of the Creation and the
early Church. As much as the translation, the illustrations of Tupinambá skin
would have reflected the Brethren’s desire to establish a new foundation for
Christendom in the New World.<br/></p>
